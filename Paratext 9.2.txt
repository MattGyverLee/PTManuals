''Introductions, setup''

__''Introduce yourself''__
The participant and facilitators should introduce themselves giving:

* their name
* their language
* their town
* what was the first and last (most recent) version of Paratext that you have used.
While the facilitators install Paratext 9 on the computers, the participant should read the introductory material and tick (check) the objectives that they feel confident doing in the most recent version of Paratext they have used.

* Ask questions.
* Do a revision activity.
* Give the participant time to reflect, fill in the recall exercise, add to Anki.!Stage 1 – Drafting

__''Introduction''__
There are several stages in a translation project. In this first stage you will use many of the resources to ensure that you understand the source text, then you will draft and keyboard the text of the translation along with other materials and also begin the preliminary checks.%%%

The following modules will help you in this stage:

* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#OD_Organising_your_desktop|2: OD – Organising your desktop))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#PP1_Project_plan_and_progress_|3: PP1 – Project plan and progress ))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#KD_Keyboarding_your_draft|4: KD – Keyboarding your draft))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#BC1_Basic_checks|5: BC1 – Basic checks))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#PP2_Project_progress|6: PP2 – Project progress))
!2: __OD – Organising your desktop__

__''Introduction''__
As you work with your text in Paratext 9 you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.

__''Where we are''__
We are getting ready to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.

__''Why this is important''__
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.

__''What are you going to do?''__
You will start the Paratext 9 program and open a previously saved layout (text combination). If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are a number of videos available to help you with the different types of resources and arranging the windows. E.g. 0.2.1b-0.2.1d, 0.2.2a
{BOX}

__''Changes in Paratext 9''__

The menus have changed in Paratext 9. To see the menu, you now need to click on the menu icon ≡. There are now two types of menus. The main Paratext menu is on the title bar ({img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgfr/IconParatextMenu.png" class=img-responsive}) and each window (or tab) has its own menu ({img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgfr/Iconprojmenu.png" class=img-responsive}). When you click on one of these menu icons all the menus are displayed and you just need to click on the command.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
In the manual, when it says __≡ Paratext__, under __Menu__ > __Command__. It means click on the Paratext menu icon ≡, then under the menu (e.g. File) choose the command (e.g. Open). And when it says __≡ Tab__, under __Menu__ > __Command__ it means click on the tab menu icon, then under the menu (e.g. Tools) click on the command (e.g. Wordlist)

!3: __PP1 – Project plan and progress __{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/PT9.png" class=img-responsive}

__''Introduction''__
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and to see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task, you should mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [[If you have used an earlier version, you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 9.]

__''Where are we?''__
Before you can use the plan, it must have been configured. [[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]

__''Why is this important?''__
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisors and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).

__''What are we going to do?''__
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

----

!4: __KD – Keyboarding your draft__

__''Introduction''__
This module explains how to keyboard your draft translations into a project in Paratext 9.

__''Where we are''__
We are about to keyboard text into an existing project. Before you can do that, someone must have already installed the program and created a project for your data.

__''Why this is important''__
This is the first stage of entering your translation into the computer. Once the text has been typed, you can run various checks on the content and format of the text.

----
!!4.1: Go to a Biblical verse

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can start typing your text, you need to move your cursor to the right book, chapter and verse. You use the toolbar to do this.
{BOX}
* Using the icons on the toolbar, change the project, book, chapter and verse as needed.%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image12.png" class=img-responsive}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you don't know the verse reference, you could use the __Find__ feature to look for a word. Ctrl+F.
{BOX}
----
!!4.2: Check that the project is editable

* Look at the titlebar of your project.%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image13.png" class=img-responsive}%%%The titlebar should have the word (Editable).
* If the book is not editable, and you need to edit it, you should talk with your project administrator.
* If it is not editable, try changing the view (see below).
----
!!4.3: Changing the view

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext 9 has five views. All but the Preview view are editable.

* Type the keys as in the table in Appendix .
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: You can use __≡ Tab__ under __View__ > __Highlight Invalid Characters__ to quickly see if you have typed any invalid characters.
{BOX}
----
!!4.5: Adding text in another marker – title or introduction

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Each piece of text needs to have a marker. The markers for the chapters and verses are already in your project. When you want to add text such as headings, or introductions etc you need to also add the appropriate marker as follows:
{BOX}
* Move your cursor to the end of the previous paragraph:
* Type __Enter__ or type « `\` »
* Type the marker (e.g. `s1` or `ip`) « __Enter__ » (or select it from the list).

!5: __BC1 – Basic checks__

__''Introduction ''__
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers using two methods: The Project plan and the project menus (Checking).

__''Where we are''__
You have typed your text in Paratext 9. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks. The remaining checks are covered in ((Paratext 9 – Stage 2|#BC2_Basic_Checks|12: BC2 – Basic Checks)) and 

__''Why this is important''__
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage.

__''What you are going to do''__
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods. The easiest way is to run the checks from the project plan. However, you can also do the checks from the project menu __(Tools)__ if you need to check more than one book at a time.

----

!6: __PP2 – Project progress__

__''Introduction''__
In this module, you will learn how to update your progress by marking tasks as completed. You will also create a progress report.

__''Where we are''__
You have been working on your translation and have finished a task. You now want to update your progress.

__''Why this is important''__
For the project plan to work well, you need to mark the tasks you have finished. This allows Paratext 9 to make the next task available for the other team members. It also gives Paratext accurate information on your progress for the reports. Creating a progress reports helps you prepare a report for your supervisors and funders.

__''What you are going to do''__
You will open the assignments and progress window and update the progress made. You will then produce a report.

----

The second stage of a translation project involves checking by the team. In this second stage you will use many tools to ensure that you have been consistent in your translation. You will read through your text, work on proper names, Biblical key terms, spell checking, and formatting checks. You will also print out a draft and use a variety of notes: project notes, spelling notes, Biblical terms discussion notes to record your questions, discussions and decisions.%%%

!7: __PN – Proper Names__

__''Introduction''__
In this module, you will check that the proper names have been transliterated consistently. There are two ways to do this. One way is to have Paratext guess the proper names based on statistical analysis of a model text. The other way is to tell Paratext the changes for specific characters.

__''Where we are''__
You have (or are working on) the rules for transliterating the names.

__''Why this is important''__
You want to be consistent so that is clear who is being referred to in the text.

__''What you are going to do''__
You will:

* filter the Major Biblical terms list on Names.
* EITHER use the __Guess renderings__ tool to guess the appropriate rendering of the names.
* OR use the __Adapt Names__ tool to enter your transliteration rules for each letter.
* edit and approve the individual names.
* add the approved names as proposed names in the Biblical terms list.
* work through the Biblical Terms list to ensure that all the verses are consistent.

!8: __SP – Spell Checking__

__''Introduction''__
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into your project in Paratext 9.

__''Where we are''__
You have typed your text in Paratext 9 and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.

__''Why is this important?''__
It is important to correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.

__''What you are going to do''__
* Configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words.
* Work through your text with red squiggly lines showing words that Paratext does not know are correct.
* Work through your wordlist, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 9 that the words are correct.
* Use a variety of checks from the word list.
* Add a spelling discussion note to words that require further discussion before a correct spelling is decided.
----
!!8.1: Configure the word list

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:
{BOX}
!!!8.1.1: Approve the spelling of common words

In Paratext

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Wordlist__
In the Wordlist

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Approve spelling of common words__
* Enter a number
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100 but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the accuracy of the typist).
{BOX}
* Click __OK__
* Click __Yes__ (to confirm that you cannot undo)
!!!8.1.2: Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect

In the Wordlist (__≡ Tab__ under __Tools__ > __Word List__)

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Spell Check > All checks__%%%''A list of word s is displayed.''
* Click on a word in the top pane.
* If the word is correct – click the green checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image26.png" class=img-responsive} at the top of the column
* If the word is incorrect, but Paratext 9 has suggested the correct word, then click the blue link for the correct word.
* If the word is incorrect, and Paratext 9 hasn’t suggested the correct word, click on the red checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image26a.png" class=img-responsive} and correct the word. (See 9.3)
!!!8.1.3: Check similarly spelled words

In the Wordlist

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Find Similar Words__
* Enter letters which sound alike separated by `/` (e.g. `s`/`sh`/`z`)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Depending on your language, tick or untick “Ignore all diacritics when comparing words”.
{BOX}
* Click __OK__ %%%''A list of words is displayed.''
* Correct the words (as described above).
----
!!8.2: Spell checking – from the text

In Paratext

* __≡ Tab__, under __View__ > __Display spelling__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
A progress meter is displayed initially, then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.
{BOX}


!!!8.2.1: Making corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext 9 will underline in red the words that have not been approved in the word list. This either means that the word is misspelled or unknown.
{BOX}
* Right-click a word which is underlined in either red or grey%%%''A dialogue is displayed'' %%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list
* Click __OK__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext 9 will remember the correction and you can apply the correction if it happens again.
{BOX}


{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed. Choose as appropriate:

__Yes__ = changes this verse and looks for the next%%%__No__ = skips this verse and looks for the next%%%__Yes to all__ – is too dangerous, DON’T use it%%%__Cancel__ = stops further changes

!9: __GL – Glossary__

__''Introduction''__
This module explains how to add entries to the glossary using the __Biblical terms__ tool.

__''Where we are''__
You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 9. Now you will add some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.

__''Why this is important''__
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the __Biblical terms__ tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.

__''What you are going to do''__
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are four training videos available on adding, linking and editing glossaries. P9 1A.4a-d.

!10: __BT – A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms__

__''Introduction''__
The __Biblical terms rendering__ window and the separate __Biblical terms__ tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. With many terms over many books this can become quite a task. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This is a process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.

__''Where we are''__
You are translating a verse in Paratext 9 and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.

__''Why this is important''__
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.

__''What you are going to do''__
This method boils down to a short list of steps:

# [[A] Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
# [[B] Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
# [[C] Document why you rejected the other renderings.
# [[D] Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
* Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
----
!!10.1: Open the Biblical terms rending window

* Click in your project
* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Biblical terms rendering__
* __≡ Tab__ (of the new window), under __Biblical Terms__ > __Select Biblical terms list__
* Choose the desired list
* Click __OK__.
----
!!10.2: A: Find all the ways you have rendered this term

!!!10.2.1: Find the terms for the current verse

* Is there a tick in the found column?
* If there is a tick, your verse uses the term and you can continue with the next term.
* If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).
!!!10.2.2: Add another rendering

If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:

* Select the rendering of the term in your text.
* Copy it (__Ctrl__+__C__)
* Double-click in the renderings cell.%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/renderings1.png" class=img-responsive}%%%''The edit renderings dialog is displayed.''%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/renderings1a.png" class=img-responsive}
* Paste (__Ctrl__+__V__) the rendering in the dialog box.
* Click __OK__.
!!!10.2.3: Find other verses in the current book with the same Biblical term

* Double-click on a word in the __Term__ column%%%''The Biblical Terms Tool opens''
* From the second filter button choose __current book__%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/renderings1b.png" class=img-responsive}
* Add renderings for the term from the verses until the terms in all verses are been identified (see below).
!!!10.2.4: Add renderings from the other verses

* Select the rendering in the verse
* Add the rendering using __Ctrl__+__A__
* Continue until all terms for those verses have been identified.
!!!10.2.5: Dealing with verses that do not use the term

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example, when a pronoun is used. In this case you need to deny that it is an error.
{BOX}
* Click the red cross {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive} to the left of the verse reference link. The red cross turns into a green tick with a small red x {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you click on the cross by mistake, click {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive} and it will return to {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive}.

!12: __BC2 – Basic Checks__

__''Introduction''__
In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (__Characters__, __punctuation__, __capitals__, and __repeated words__. As in the first Basic Checks module (((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#BC1_Basic_checks|5: BC1 – Basic checks))), it is easiest to run these checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the __Verification__ menu.
Where are we?
You have typed your translation in Paratext 9. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#BC1_Basic_checks|5: BC1 – Basic checks)), before continuing and that your administrator has either completed the setup of the checks or is with you to do the setup now.

__''Why this is important?''__
Paratext 9 has eleven __Basic Checks__. In ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#BC1_Basic_checks|5: BC1 – Basic checks)), you have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to spelling, punctuation, capital letters and repeated words. Even though these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.

__''What we are going to do:''__
Most of the checks require that an inventory has been completed by your administrator. In this module you will

* Confirm that the setup has been done (or have the administrator do the setup)
* do the Basic Checks
* correct any errors.
----
!!12.1: Confirm the setup

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done. Some checks require an inventory others require settings. You can do most of the inventories, but only your Administrator can do the settings.
{BOX}
The required setup may be an inventory, some rules or settings.

----
!!12.2: Using inventories to setup checks

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 9 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).
{BOX}
Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.

* From the __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Checking inventories__ menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
* Click on an item in the list in the top pane.%%%''The verses are shown in the bottom pane.''
* For each item in the top pane, choose either __Valid__ or __Invalid__.
* Repeat for each item.
* Click __OK__.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Instead of using the mouse, you can use __Ctrl__ + __y__ to mark an entry as __Valid__ or __Ctrl__ + __n__ to mark an entry as __Invalid__.
{BOX}
----
!!12.3: Characters

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check (and inventory) helps you identify all the incorrect characters, i.e. the characters which are not in your alphabet.

----
!!12.8: Making minor corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
It is possible to make minor corrections from within a displayed inventory. However, if there are several errors it is best to run the check to make the corrections.
{BOX}
* Click on a verse in the lower pane
* Hold the __Shift__ and double-click
* Make the correction
* Click __OK__.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
In some cases, it is preferable to use the Wordlist or the spell checker to several errors at once.
{BOX}
!!!12.8.1: Review

There are many basic checks in Paratext 9. The table below summarizes the setup needed for each of the checks.

|||Check|Setup
Chapter/verse numbers |none 
Markers |Marker inventory 
Characters (Combinations) |Character inventory 
Punctuation |Punctuation inventory 
Capitalization%%%%%% %%% %%% %%% |4 inventories%%%Markers Missing Final Sentence Punctuation%%%Markers followed by a lower case letter%%%Punctuation Followed by a Lower Case letter%%%Mixed Capitalization

Numbers%%% |__≡ Tab__, under __Project Setting__ >%%% __Number settings__ 
References%%% |__≡ Tab__, under __Project Setting__ >%%% __Scripture reference settings __ 
Quoted text |none ||
It is possible to run all the checks at the same time, however when running the checks for the first time it is better to run them one at a time to avoid large list of errors.

!13: __FC – Formatting checks__

__''Introduction''__
In this module, you will find and correct formatting and layout errors.

__''Where we are''__
You have typed your draft into a project in Paratext. You will use the checklists to find and correct errors related to the formatting and layout errors.

__''Why this is important''__
A New Testament contains more than just chapters and verses. There are also titles, section headings, and several types of paragraphs. These checks allow you to be sure that the layout of your text is correct, and your titles etc. are consistent.

__''What are you going to do?''__
You will use the checklists to

* compare your titles and section headings
* check your paragraph breaks 
* compare the paragraph markers in your text with those of your reference text
* add markers for special text formatting. 
----
!!13.1: Using the checklists – generic

!14: __PD – Printing Drafts__

__''Introduction''__
In this module you will learn how to print a draft of your translation for checking and revising.

__''Where we are''__
You have entered and checked your translation in Paratext 9 and are now ready to print out a copy. Your project must be registered before you can print.

__''Why this is important''__
It is much easier to revise and check your work on paper than on the computer. You can also give it to more people if it is on paper.

__''What you are going to do''__
You will first produce a PDF version of your translation, which you can print or share with others (including non-Paratext users). If necessary, you can copy the PDF file onto your USB stick and take it to a computer with a printer.

----
!!14.1: Create a PDF file

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Make sure you have completed the markers check before printing a draft.
{BOX}

* Click __OK__ and wait, the file will open in your PDF reader.%%%''If there are marker errors, a message box will appear. Click __No__, then correct the errors and try again.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: The first time you print a draft it takes a long time collecting information on the fonts. But it will be much quicker the next time.
{BOX}
----
!!14.2: Print a PDF

In Adobe Reader

* (Make sure the PDF file is open.)
* __File__ > __Print.__
* For A5
** Choose __Booklet__

!15: __UN – Using Notes__

__''Introduction ''__
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext 9 allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.

__''Where we are''__
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Attention: Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.
{BOX}
__''What you are going to do''__
You will:

* add more note types (administrator only)
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* open, edit, and resolve notes
* open a notes list
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
----

!16: __BT1 – Draft a Back Translation__

__''Introduction''__
In preparing for a consultant check, the consultant will need one or more versions of your text in a language they understand. This is often called a back-translation. There are two types of back translations. This module explains how to do a free back-translation and keep it up to date. The next module explains how to do a word-for-word back-translation using the project interlinearizer.

__''Where we are''__
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.

__''Why is this important?''__
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term “back translation” comes from. The consult will use this translation to help your team improve your exegetical choices in the text.

It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.

__''What will you do?''__
* Open your project and back translation project
* Arrange your text on the screen.
* Draft your back translation
* Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
* Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.

!17: __BT2 – Interlinearize a project__

__''Introduction''__
The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Please note that in Paratext 9 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.
{BOX}
__''Where we are''__
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check by doing a word-for-word back translation. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word-for-word back translation. [[This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]

__''Why this is important''__
Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.

__''What you will do''__
You will use the project interlinearizer to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will setup the interlinearizer, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can approve the glosses and move to the next verse with unapproved glosses.

----
!!17.1: Configure the project interlinearizer

* Click in your project
* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Open Project interlinearizer__%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/Interl1.png" class=img-responsive}
* Click to dropdown the list [[1].
* Choose to create glosses based on a model text. This is usually your reference text or your free back translation project [[2]
* Choose your model text [[3].
* Click __OK__
----
!!17.2: Correct the interlinearized text

To correct glosses

* Click the incorrect gloss%%%''A list is displayed.''
* Either click on the correct gloss in the list%%%or type the correct gloss in the textbox
* Click __Enter__
----
!!17.3: Translate/gloss a phrase

* Click between two words%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/36imgeng/image17.png" class=img-responsive}
* Click the icon {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/36imgfr/link.png" class=img-responsive} __Link words __
* Click the red line
* Type the gloss
----
!!17.4: Add extra words

* Click in the space between two glosses
* Type the extra word(s)
----
!!17.5: Specify the morphology – break a word into morphemes

* Click on the word in the translation line (top line)
* Click « __Add word parse__ »
* Add __spaces__ to separate the morphemes and add « `+` » prefixes and suffixes (see guide)
* Click __OK__
----
!!17.6: Approve and Export the text

When you approve and export the text any remaining red glosses will be approved.

* Click __Approve glosses__
* To continue, click __Next Unapproved Verse__
----
!!17.7: Help

For more help on using the Interlinearizer function see the following topics in the Paratext Help:

* Introduction to Project Interlinearizer
* How do I open the Project Interlinearizer?
* How do I generate an interlinear back translation?
* How do I create a back translation project with the Interlinearizer?
* How do I create a text revision/adaptation project with the Interlinearizer?
* What do the colours of glosses mean in the Interlinearizer?
!18: __CT – Compare Text__

__''Introduction ''__
In this module, you will learn how to save old versions of your text and review them later.

__''Where are we? ''__
You have worked on your text and you have arrived at an important stage of your project.

__''Why is this important?''__
As you work on your translation, you are continually making changes. It is good to have a copy of the previous version of your text, for example the text as it was before you went to a consultant check. You can do this by marking a point in the history of your project. After marking a point in the history, you can compare the version at that point with the current version.

__''What will you do?''__
You will mark a point in the history of the project which you can go back to later and compare your work.

----
!!18.1: Mark Point in History

* Click in your project window to make it active (in Paratext).
* __≡ Tab__ under __Project__ > __Mark a point in project history__
* Type a comment to describe the point.
* Click __OK__
----
!!18.2: Compare Two Versions

* __≡ Tab__ under __Project__ > __Compare Versions__
* Click on the version dropdown list Current version
* Choose the desired point in the history%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/36imgeng/CompareTexts.png" class=img-responsive}%%%''The screen will change and show the differences between both versions.''
!19: __BC3 – Basic checks 3__

__''Introduction''__
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.

__''Where we are''__
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules BC1 and BC2 before continuing. And that either your administrator has done the setup for the checks or is available to do the setup with you.

__''Why this is important''__
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks helps you find errors related to material referred from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.

__''What you are going to do''__
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:

* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.
----
!!19.1: Unmatched pairs of Punctuation

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check looks at punctuation that occurs in pairs (opening and closing) and lists errors where it is not matched by the other half of the pair. This may be deliberate but is more likely to be an error, e.g. ( ), [[ ], etc.
{BOX}
!!!19.1.1: Setup – inventory

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Checking Inventories__ > __Unmatched pairs of punctuation__:%%%''If the list is empty, then there are no errors.''

* Click the __Book names__ tab%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/36imgeng/image19.png" class=img-responsive}
* Fill-in the three columns [[1] with abbreviation, short name and long name.
* Choose __Abbreviations__ [[2] and [[3] for both cross-references and references
* Click __OK__
* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Run Basic Checks__
* Click « __References »__
* Click__ OK__
* Correct any errors.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext will inform you if there are any inconsistencies between these book name settings and the \toc lines and will allow you to check conflicts.
{BOX}
----
!!19.3: Numbers check

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can run the references check, your Administrator must define various number settings.
{BOX}
* __≡ Tab,__ under __Project settings__ > __Number settings__

----
!!19.6: Quoted text

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The Quoted text check looks at text in footnotes or cross-references which has been marked with \qt \qt* markers. It checks that the quoted text matches the text in the verse.
{BOX}
* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Run basic checks__
* __Quoted text__
* Click __OK__.%%%''A list of errors is displayed.''
* Make corrections as needed.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: The text has to be exactly the same as in the text. That is, even additional punctuation cannot be in the \qt … \\qt* markers.
{BOX}!__Stage 4: Consultant Visit__

__''Introduction''__
''Note: This stage is not included in the UBS plan.''

The fourth stage of a translation project is the consultant visit. You will meet with the consultant and evaluate your text, make notes and revise your texts and back translations as needed. You will want to ensure that you have updated the status of your translation in the project plan.





Most of the tasks in this stage have been covered in previous modules.

The following modules will help you in this stage:

* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 4|#Collaboration_tools|20: Collaboration tools))
* See also Stage one and two.
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 3|#BT1_Draft_a_Back_Translation|16: BT1 – Draft a Back Translation))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 3|#BT2_Interlinearize_a_project|17: BT2 – Interlinearize a project))


!20: Collaboration tools

__''Introduction''__
In this module you will use Paratext Live as a way that the team can collaborate together so that everyone can see the changes to the text on their own computers.

__''Where we are''__
We have already seen how to collaborate with Send/Receive. There are times, for example during a consultant check, when several people need to look at the same text, and perhaps edit it together. Paratext Live allows everyone to look at the text on their own computer and see the changes being made in real time.

__''Why this is important''__
There are several other ways to let everyone look at the same text. But Paratext Live not only lets everyone see the text, but it also allows more than one person to edit the text.

__''What are you going to do?''__
* Connect all users to the same network.
* Send/receive.
* Start Paratext Live and join a session
* Edit the document
* Exchange all files
* Exit Paratext Live
* Send/receive
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
See the video 4.1 Collaboration Tools.
{BOX}
----
!!20.1: Paratext Live

Before you can start Paratext Live, all users must do a send/receive and everyone must be connected to the same network.



!!!20.1.1: Send/receive

Before you start Paratext Live all participants should Send/Receive the project. Paratext will tell you that you need to Send/Receive.

!!!20.1.2: Connect to the same network

Paratext Live can use

* Internet
* a local network
* offline WiFi router
* hotspot with mobile data disabled.
!!!20.1.3: Start Paratext Live

* Open the menu for the project.
* Under __Tools__, click __Paratext Live__.
* Or use the icon on the toolbar.
* Click __Start/Join Live session__. ''If Autosave in Paratext Settings is not on, the Live session will turn it on for the duration of the session. ''
* Paratext then asks if you are the primary editor: 
** If you are __not__ the primary editor, __wait__, don’t press cancel as that will cancel your joining the live session.
** If you __are__ the primary editor, click __Start as Primary Editor__. %%%''With a session active, the Paratext Live button is green''
!!!20.1.4: Sharing changes from Tools

All scripture text is shared when you do a send/receive. However, changes made with various tools are not shared automatically. Examples of these unshared changes are to spelling status, Parallel passage status, Biblical Terms and their identified renderings, and Notes. To share these changes:

* Click the Paratext Live button on the toolbar,
* Click “__Exchange all files__” %%%''All of the users in the Paratext Live session then receive updates to these files.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Changes from all users are shared, but if two people have changed the exact same item differently, only one person’s change will be saved.
{BOX}
!!!20.1.5: End the Paratext Live session

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
__Note__: If one participant has upgraded to Paratext 9.2, __everyone__ participating needs to upgrade as Paratext Live files are slightly different in version 9.2.

__For more help__, search for '__live__' in the search box on the title bar. There are lots of useful helpful topics to help you use Paratext Live
{BOX}!__Stage 5 / Stage 3 UBS: Review by the community__

__''Introduction''__
''Note: This is equivalent to the third stage of the UBS plan.''

The fifth stage of a translation project is the review by the community. In the review you will check for naturalness, produce a team progress report and revise the key terms.



The following modules will help you in this stage:

* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 5|#PPR\:_Progress_report|21: PPR: Progress report))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 5|#BTR\:_Biblical_key_terms_report|22: BTR: Biblical key terms report))
!21: __PPR: Progress report__

__''Introduction''__
In this module you will create a progress report.

__''Where we are''__
As you have been working on your translation, you have been updating your project plan with your progress on completed chapters and books. Now you will prepare a project a report.

__''Why this is important''__
Your administrators and funders need accurate reports of your progress.

__''What are you going to do?''__
* Check that your project plan is up-to-date.
* Produce several reports.
----

One task in this stage is to produce a report of the changes made in the key biblical terms.

__''Where we are''__
In working on your translation you have identified and changed a number of key biblical terms.

__''Why is this important?''__
Although you can’t use Paratext to write the report, it can produce of list of the terms that you have been dealing with and may need to include in your report.

__''What are you going to do?''__
In the Biblical terms tool you will filter on the book(s) that you want to include in your report. You will then save the list of the terms as a separate HTML file. You can also filter the list on any discussion notes you may have made.

!!24.7: Check and link glossary entries

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Linking glossary items to the text is done from the Biblical Terms tool, and is usually one of the last tasks before publication to ensure that none are missed due to further corrections. If you have already linked terms it may be necessary to unlink terms before linking again.
{BOX}
* Open the Biblical Terms Tool
* Filter on __Glossary entries__
* Select one or more terms
* __≡ Tab__, under __Edit__ > __Link selected entries to the glossary __ %%%''A dialog box is displayed'' %%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/LinkGloss1.png" class=img-responsive}
* Choose __First occurrence in every section__ %%%''A results list is displayed of each verse linked and any errors.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Warnings: It is wise to only link a few terms at a time. Be careful if there are homographs as Paratext may mistake one for the other. Also be careful when a rendering for one term is part of a phrase in another term. Also you may need to add Biblical terms for some glossary entries.

!!24.9: Check parallel passages

* See module PP: Parallel passages
!25: __PP – Compare Parallel Passages__

__''Introduction''__
There are thousands of passages in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.

__''Where we are''__
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first before comparing the texts. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.

__''Why this is important''__
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.

Normally you would make the comparisons after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.

__''What you are going to do''__
* use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
* use the check boxes to tell Paratext that you have checked the passages
* filter for any changed verses
* open a quick reference window in Paratext to see another passage while you are translating.
* open a third passage in a window at the same time.

__''Introduce yourself''__
The participant and facilitators should introduce themselves giving:

* their name
* their language
* their town
* what was the first and last (most recent) version of Paratext that you have used.
While the facilitators install Paratext 9 on the computers, the participant should read the introductory material and tick (check) the objectives that they feel confident doing in the most recent version of Paratext they have used.

__''For each module''__
* Do a revision activity of the previous module.

* Ask questions.
* Do a revision activity.
* Give the participant time to reflect, fill in the recall exercise, add to Anki.!Stage 1 – Drafting

__''Introduction''__
There are several stages in a translation project. In this first stage you will use many of the resources to ensure that you understand the source text, then you will draft and keyboard the text of the translation along with other materials and also begin the preliminary checks.%%%

The following modules will help you in this stage:

* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#OD_Organising_your_desktop|2: OD – Organising your desktop))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#PP1_Project_plan_and_progress_|3: PP1 – Project plan and progress ))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#KD_Keyboarding_your_draft|4: KD – Keyboarding your draft))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#BC1_Basic_checks|5: BC1 – Basic checks))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#PP2_Project_progress|6: PP2 – Project progress))
!2: __OD – Organising your desktop__

__''Introduction''__
As you work with your text in Paratext 9 you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.

__''Where we are''__
We are getting ready to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.

__''Why this is important''__
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.

__''What are you going to do?''__
You will start the Paratext 9 program and open a previously saved layout (text combination). If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are a number of videos available to help you with the different types of resources and arranging the windows. E.g. 0.2.1b-0.2.1d, 0.2.2a
{BOX}

__''Changes in Paratext 9''__

The menus have changed in Paratext 9. To see the menu, you now need to click on the menu icon ≡. There are now two types of menus. The main Paratext menu is on the title bar ({img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgfr/IconParatextMenu.png" class=img-responsive}) and each window (or tab) has its own menu ({img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgfr/Iconprojmenu.png" class=img-responsive}). When you click on one of these menu icons all the menus are displayed and you just need to click on the command.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
In the manual, when it says __≡ Paratext__, under __Menu__ > __Command__. It means click on the Paratext menu icon ≡, then under the menu (e.g. File) choose the command (e.g. Open). And when it says __≡ Tab__, under __Menu__ > __Command__ it means click on the tab menu icon, then under the menu (e.g. Tools) click on the command (e.g. Wordlist)

!3: __PP1 – Project plan and progress __{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/PT9.png" class=img-responsive}

__''Introduction''__
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and to see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task, you should mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [[If you have used an earlier version, you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 9.]

__''Where are we?''__
Before you can use the plan, it must have been configured. [[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]

__''Why is this important?''__
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisors and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).

__''What are we going to do?''__
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

----

!4: __KD – Keyboarding your draft__

__''Introduction''__
This module explains how to keyboard your draft translations into a project in Paratext 9.

__''Where we are''__
We are about to keyboard text into an existing project. Before you can do that, someone must have already installed the program and created a project for your data.

__''Why this is important''__
This is the first stage of entering your translation into the computer. Once the text has been typed, you can run various checks on the content and format of the text.

----
!!4.1: Go to a Biblical verse

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can start typing your text, you need to move your cursor to the right book, chapter and verse. You use the toolbar to do this.
{BOX}
* Using the icons on the toolbar, change the project, book, chapter and verse as needed.%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image12.png" class=img-responsive}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you don't know the verse reference, you could use the __Find__ feature to look for a word. Ctrl+F.
{BOX}
----
!!4.2: Check that the project is editable

* Look at the titlebar of your project.%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image13.png" class=img-responsive}%%%The titlebar should have the word (Editable).
* If the book is not editable, and you need to edit it, you should talk with your project administrator.
* If it is not editable, try changing the view (see below).
----
!!4.3: Changing the view

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext 9 has five views. All but the Preview view are editable.
{BOX}
* __Ctrl__ + __E__ -or-
* __≡ Tab__ under __View__ menu, choose the view (usually Standard).
----
!!4.4: Typing special characters

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Some orthographic characters are not found on the keyboard. To type these characters, you need to press more than one key.
{BOX}
* Change your keyboard system as needed on your computer.
* If you are using Keyman then choose your keyboard (e.g. Tchad Unicode %%%(or for MS-Keyboards choose AF or TR/SQ/TZ/AF…)
* Type the keys as in the table in Appendix .
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: You can use __≡ Tab__ under __View__ > __Highlight Invalid Characters__ to quickly see if you have typed any invalid characters.
{BOX}
----
!!4.5: Adding text in another marker – title or introduction

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Each piece of text needs to have a marker. The markers for the chapters and verses are already in your project. When you want to add text such as headings, or introductions etc you need to also add the appropriate marker as follows:
{BOX}

!5: __BC1 – Basic checks__

__''Introduction ''__
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers using two methods: The Project plan and the project menus (Checking).

__''Where we are''__
You have typed your text in Paratext 9. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks. The remaining checks are covered in ((Paratext 9 – Stage 2|#BC2_Basic_Checks|12: BC2 – Basic Checks)) and 

__''Why this is important''__
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage.

__''What you are going to do''__
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods. The easiest way is to run the checks from the project plan. However, you can also do the checks from the project menu __(Tools)__ if you need to check more than one book at a time.

In this module, you will learn how to update your progress by marking tasks as completed. You will also create a progress report.

__''Where we are''__
You have been working on your translation and have finished a task. You now want to update your progress.

__''Why this is important''__
For the project plan to work well, you need to mark the tasks you have finished. This allows Paratext 9 to make the next task available for the other team members. It also gives Paratext accurate information on your progress for the reports. Creating a progress reports helps you prepare a report for your supervisors and funders.

__''What you are going to do''__
You will open the assignments and progress window and update the progress made. You will then produce a report.

The second stage of a translation project involves checking by the team. In this second stage you will use many tools to ensure that you have been consistent in your translation. You will read through your text, work on proper names, Biblical key terms, spell checking, and formatting checks. You will also print out a draft and use a variety of notes: project notes, spelling notes, Biblical terms discussion notes to record your questions, discussions and decisions.%%%

The following modules will help you in this stage:

!7: __PN – Proper Names__

__''Introduction''__
In this module, you will check that the proper names have been transliterated consistently. There are two ways to do this. One way is to have Paratext guess the proper names based on statistical analysis of a model text. The other way is to tell Paratext the changes for specific characters.

__''Where we are''__
You have (or are working on) the rules for transliterating the names.

__''Why this is important''__
You want to be consistent so that is clear who is being referred to in the text.

__''What you are going to do''__
You will:

* filter the Major Biblical terms list on Names.
* EITHER use the __Guess renderings__ tool to guess the appropriate rendering of the names.
* OR use the __Adapt Names__ tool to enter your transliteration rules for each letter.
* edit and approve the individual names.
* add the approved names as proposed names in the Biblical terms list.
* work through the Biblical Terms list to ensure that all the verses are consistent.

!8: __SP – Spell Checking__

__''Introduction''__
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into your project in Paratext 9.

__''Where we are''__
You have typed your text in Paratext 9 and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.

__''Why is this important?''__
It is important to correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.

__''What you are going to do''__
* Configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words.
* Work through your text with red squiggly lines showing words that Paratext does not know are correct.
* Work through your wordlist, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 9 that the words are correct.
* Use a variety of checks from the word list.
* Add a spelling discussion note to words that require further discussion before a correct spelling is decided.
----
!!8.1: Configure the word list

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:
{BOX}
!!!8.1.1: Approve the spelling of common words

In Paratext

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Wordlist__
In the Wordlist

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Approve spelling of common words__
* Enter a number
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100 but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the accuracy of the typist).
{BOX}
* Click __OK__
* Click __Yes__ (to confirm that you cannot undo)
!!!8.1.2: Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect

In the Wordlist (__≡ Tab__ under __Tools__ > __Word List__)

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Spell Check > All checks__%%%''A list of word s is displayed.''
* Click on a word in the top pane.
* If the word is correct – click the green checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image26.png" class=img-responsive} at the top of the column
* If the word is incorrect, but Paratext 9 has suggested the correct word, then click the blue link for the correct word.
* If the word is incorrect, and Paratext 9 hasn’t suggested the correct word, click on the red checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image26a.png" class=img-responsive} and correct the word. (See 9.3)
!!!8.1.3: Check similarly spelled words

In the Wordlist

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Find Similar Words__
* Enter letters which sound alike separated by `/` (e.g. `s`/`sh`/`z`)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Depending on your language, tick or untick “Ignore all diacritics when comparing words”.
{BOX}
* Click __OK__ %%%''A list of words is displayed.''
* Correct the words (as described above).
----
!!8.2: Spell checking – from the text

In Paratext

* __≡ Tab__, under __View__ > __Display spelling__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
A progress meter is displayed initially, then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.
{BOX}


!!!8.2.1: Making corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext 9 will underline in red the words that have not been approved in the word list. This either means that the word is misspelled or unknown.
{BOX}
* Right-click a word which is underlined in either red or grey%%%''A dialogue is displayed'' %%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list
* Click __OK__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext 9 will remember the correction and you can apply the correction if it happens again.
{BOX}


{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed. Choose as appropriate:

__Yes__ = changes this verse and looks for the next%%%__No__ = skips this verse and looks for the next%%%__Yes to all__ – is too dangerous, DON’T use it%%%__Cancel__ = stops further changes
{BOX}

!9: __GL – Glossary__

__''Introduction''__
This module explains how to add entries to the glossary using the __Biblical terms__ tool.

__''Where we are''__
You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 9. Now you will add some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.

__''Why this is important''__
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the __Biblical terms__ tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.

__''What you are going to do''__
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are four training videos available on adding, linking and editing glossaries. P9 1A.4a-d.

!10: __BT – A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms__

__''Introduction''__
The __Biblical terms rendering__ window and the separate __Biblical terms__ tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. With many terms over many books this can become quite a task. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This is a process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.

__''Where we are''__
You are translating a verse in Paratext 9 and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.

__''Why this is important''__
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.

__''What you are going to do''__
This method boils down to a short list of steps:

# [[A] Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
# [[B] Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
# [[C] Document why you rejected the other renderings.
# [[D] Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
* Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
----
!!10.1: Open the Biblical terms rending window

* Click in your project
* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Biblical terms rendering__
* __≡ Tab__ (of the new window), under __Biblical Terms__ > __Select Biblical terms list__
* Choose the desired list
* Click __OK__.
----
!!10.2: A: Find all the ways you have rendered this term

!!!10.2.1: Find the terms for the current verse

* Is there a tick in the found column?
* If there is a tick, your verse uses the term and you can continue with the next term.
* If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).
!!!10.2.2: Add another rendering

If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:

* Select the rendering of the term in your text.
* Copy it (__Ctrl__+__C__)
* Double-click in the renderings cell.%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/renderings1.png" class=img-responsive}%%%''The edit renderings dialog is displayed.''%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/renderings1a.png" class=img-responsive}

* From the second filter button choose __current book__%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/renderings1b.png" class=img-responsive}
* Add renderings for the term from the verses until the terms in all verses are been identified (see below).
!!!10.2.4: Add renderings from the other verses

* Select the rendering in the verse
* Add the rendering using __Ctrl__+__A__
* Continue until all terms for those verses have been identified.
!!!10.2.5: Dealing with verses that do not use the term

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example, when a pronoun is used. In this case you need to deny that it is an error.
{BOX}
* Click the red cross {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive} to the left of the verse reference link.

!11: __MP – Compare a word or phrase__

__''Introduction''__
In this module, you will search for a word or phrase in a project and compare it with the translation of that word or phrase in another project.

__''Why this is important?''__
In Paratext 9 (and above), you can see where a word or phrase is found in one project and compare it with the equivalent word or phrase in one or more other projects. For example, you can see where "roi" is found in a French project and compare it with "rey" in a Spanish project.

You will

* use the checklist “Word or Phrase” from both the text and also from the Biblical Terms Tool.

!12: __BC2 – Basic Checks__

__''Introduction''__
In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (__Characters__, __punctuation__, __capitals__, and __repeated words__. As in the first Basic Checks module (((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#BC1_Basic_checks|5: BC1 – Basic checks))), it is easiest to run these checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the __Verification__ menu.
Where are we?
You have typed your translation in Paratext 9. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#BC1_Basic_checks|5: BC1 – Basic checks)), before continuing and that your administrator has either completed the setup of the checks or is with you to do the setup now.

__''Why this is important?''__
Paratext 9 has eleven __Basic Checks__. In ((Paratext 9 – Stage 1|#BC1_Basic_checks|5: BC1 – Basic checks)), you have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to spelling, punctuation, capital letters and repeated words. Even though these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.

__''What we are going to do:''__
Most of the checks require that an inventory has been completed by your administrator. In this module you will

* Confirm that the setup has been done (or have the administrator do the setup)
* do the Basic Checks
* correct any errors.
----
!!12.1: Confirm the setup

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done. Some checks require an inventory others require settings. You can do most of the inventories, but only your Administrator can do the settings.
{BOX}
The required setup may be an inventory, some rules or settings.

----
!!12.2: Using inventories to setup checks

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 9 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).
{BOX}
Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.

* From the __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Checking inventories__ menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
* Click on an item in the list in the top pane.%%%''The verses are shown in the bottom pane.''
* For each item in the top pane, choose either __Valid__ or __Invalid__.
* Repeat for each item.
* Click __OK__.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Instead of using the mouse, you can use __Ctrl__ + __y__ to mark an entry as __Valid__ or __Ctrl__ + __n__ to mark an entry as __Invalid__.
{BOX}
----
!!12.3: Characters

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check (and inventory) helps you identify all the incorrect characters, i.e. the characters which are not in your alphabet.

----
!!12.8: Making minor corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
It is possible to make minor corrections from within a displayed inventory. However, if there are several errors it is best to run the check to make the corrections.
{BOX}
* Click on a verse in the lower pane
* Hold the __Shift__ and double-click
* Make the correction
* Click __OK__.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
In some cases, it is preferable to use the Wordlist or the spell checker to several errors at once.
{BOX}
!!!12.8.1: Review

There are many basic checks in Paratext 9. The table below summarizes the setup needed for each of the checks.

|||Check|Setup
Chapter/verse numbers |none 
Markers |Marker inventory 
Characters (Combinations) |Character inventory 
Punctuation |Punctuation inventory 
Capitalization%%%%%% %%% %%% %%% |4 inventories%%%Markers Missing Final Sentence Punctuation%%%Markers followed by a lower case letter%%%Punctuation Followed by a Lower Case letter%%%Mixed Capitalization

It is possible to run all the checks at the same time, however when running the checks for the first time it is better to run them one at a time to avoid large list of errors.

!13: __FC – Formatting checks__

__''Introduction''__
In this module, you will find and correct formatting and layout errors.

__''Where we are''__
You have typed your draft into a project in Paratext. You will use the checklists to find and correct errors related to the formatting and layout errors.

__''Why this is important''__
A New Testament contains more than just chapters and verses. There are also titles, section headings, and several types of paragraphs. These checks allow you to be sure that the layout of your text is correct, and your titles etc. are consistent.

__''What are you going to do?''__
You will use the checklists to

* compare your titles and section headings
* check your paragraph breaks 
* compare the paragraph markers in your text with those of your reference text
* add markers for special text formatting. 
----
!!13.1: Using the checklists – generic

!14: __PD – Printing Drafts__

__''Introduction''__
In this module you will learn how to print a draft of your translation for checking and revising.

__''Where we are''__
You have entered and checked your translation in Paratext 9 and are now ready to print out a copy. Your project must be registered before you can print.

__''Why this is important''__
It is much easier to revise and check your work on paper than on the computer. You can also give it to more people if it is on paper.

__''What you are going to do''__
You will first produce a PDF version of your translation, which you can print or share with others (including non-Paratext users). If necessary, you can copy the PDF file onto your USB stick and take it to a computer with a printer.

----
!!14.1: Create a PDF file

* Choose __Send to__
* Choose your USB stick.
!15: __UN – Using Notes__

__''Introduction ''__
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext 9 allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.

__''Where we are''__
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Attention: Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.
{BOX}
__''What you are going to do''__
You will:

* add more note types (administrator only)
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* open, edit, and resolve notes
* open a notes list
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
----
!!15.1: Different types of project notes

!16: __BT1 – Draft a Back Translation__

__''Introduction''__
In preparing for a consultant check, the consultant will need one or more versions of your text in a language they understand. This is often called a back-translation. There are two types of back translations. This module explains how to do a free back-translation and keep it up to date. The next module explains how to do a word-for-word back-translation using the project interlinearizer.

__''Where we are''__
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.

__''Why is this important?''__
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term “back translation” comes from. The consult will use this translation to help your team improve your exegetical choices in the text.

It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.

__''What will you do?''__
* Open your project and back translation project
* Arrange your text on the screen.
* Draft your back translation
* Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
* Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.
----
!!16.1: Create a new project for the back translation

(First time only, by Administrator)

* __≡ Paratext__ under __Paratext__ > __New Project__
* Click __Edit__
* Type a full name for the project and a short name
* Click __OK__
* Choose the language for your back translation (e.g. English)
* Leave the versification
* For the Type of project choose "__Back Translation__"
* For __Based on__ choose your project%%%''If necessary, Paratext will change the versification to match your project.''
* Click the __Books__ tab
* Choose the desired books
* Click __OK__
* Click the __Create Book(s)__ link
* Create books as needed.
----
!!16.2: Draft your back translation

* Open your project
* Open your back translation project
* Arrange the windows so that you can easily see both windows.

!17: __BT2 – Interlinearize a project__

__''Introduction''__
The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function.

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Please note that in Paratext 9 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.
{BOX}
__''Where we are''__
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check by doing a word-for-word back translation. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word-for-word back translation. [[This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]

__''Why this is important''__
Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.

__''What you will do''__
You will use the project interlinearizer to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will setup the interlinearizer, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can approve the glosses and move to the next verse with unapproved glosses.

----
!!17.1: Configure the project interlinearizer

* Click in your project
* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Open Project interlinearizer__%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/Interl1.png" class=img-responsive}
* Click to dropdown the list [[1].
* Choose to create glosses based on a model text. This is usually your reference text or your free back translation project [[2]
* Choose your model text [[3].
* Click __OK__
----
!!17.2: Correct the interlinearized text

To correct glosses

* Click the incorrect gloss%%%''A list is displayed.''
* Either click on the correct gloss in the list%%%or type the correct gloss in the textbox
* Click __Enter__
----
!!17.3: Translate/gloss a phrase

* Click between two words%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/36imgeng/image17.png" class=img-responsive}
* Click the icon {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/36imgfr/link.png" class=img-responsive} __Link words __
* Click the red line
* Type the gloss
----
!!17.4: Add extra words

* Click in the space between two glosses
* Type the extra word(s)
----
!!17.5: Specify the morphology – break a word into morphemes

* Click on the word in the translation line (top line)
* Click « __Add word parse__ »
* Add __spaces__ to separate the morphemes and add « `+` » prefixes and suffixes (see guide)
* Click __OK__
----
!!17.6: Approve and Export the text

When you approve and export the text any remaining red glosses will be approved.

* Click __Approve glosses__
* To continue, click __Next Unapproved Verse__
----
!!17.7: Help

For more help on using the Interlinearizer function see the following topics in the Paratext Help:

* Introduction to Project Interlinearizer
* How do I open the Project Interlinearizer?
* How do I generate an interlinear back translation?
* How do I create a back translation project with the Interlinearizer?
* How do I create a text revision/adaptation project with the Interlinearizer?
* What do the colours of glosses mean in the Interlinearizer?
!18: __CT – Compare Text__

__''Introduction ''__
In this module, you will learn how to save old versions of your text and review them later.

__''Where are we? ''__
You have worked on your text and you have arrived at an important stage of your project.

__''Why is this important?''__
As you work on your translation, you are continually making changes. It is good to have a copy of the previous version of your text, for example the text as it was before you went to a consultant check. You can do this by marking a point in the history of your project. After marking a point in the history, you can compare the version at that point with the current version.

__''What will you do?''__
You will mark a point in the history of the project which you can go back to later and compare your work.

----
!!18.1: Mark Point in History

* Click in your project window to make it active (in Paratext).
* __≡ Tab__ under __Project__ > __Mark a point in project history__
* Type a comment to describe the point.
* Click __OK__
----
!!18.2: Compare Two Versions

* __≡ Tab__ under __Project__ > __Compare Versions__

* Choose the desired point in the history%%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/36imgeng/CompareTexts.png" class=img-responsive}%%%''The screen will change and show the differences between both versions.''
!19: __BC3 – Basic checks 3__

__''Introduction''__
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.

__''Where we are''__
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules BC1 and BC2 before continuing. And that either your administrator has done the setup for the checks or is available to do the setup with you.

__''Why this is important''__
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks helps you find errors related to material referred from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.

__''What you are going to do''__
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:

* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.
----
!!19.1: Unmatched pairs of Punctuation

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check looks at punctuation that occurs in pairs (opening and closing) and lists errors where it is not matched by the other half of the pair. This may be deliberate but is more likely to be an error, e.g. ( ), [[ ], etc.
{BOX}
!!!19.1.1: Setup – inventory

* __≡ Tab__, under __Tools__ > __Checking Inventories__ > __Unmatched pairs of punctuation__:%%%''If the list is empty, then there are no errors.''

{BOX}!__Stage 4: Consultant Visit__

__''Introduction''__
''Note: This stage is not included in the UBS plan.''

The fourth stage of a translation project is the consultant visit. You will meet with the consultant and evaluate your text, make notes and revise your texts and back translations as needed. You will want to ensure that you have updated the status of your translation in the project plan.





Most of the tasks in this stage have been covered in previous modules.

The following modules will help you in this stage:

* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 4|#Collaboration_tools|20: Collaboration tools))
* See also Stage one and two.
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 3|#BT1_Draft_a_Back_Translation|16: BT1 – Draft a Back Translation))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 3|#BT2_Interlinearize_a_project|17: BT2 – Interlinearize a project))


!20: Collaboration tools

__''Introduction''__
In this module you will use Paratext Live as a way that the team can collaborate together so that everyone can see the changes to the text on their own computers.

__''Where we are''__
We have already seen how to collaborate with Send/Receive. There are times, for example during a consultant check, when several people need to look at the same text, and perhaps edit it together. Paratext Live allows everyone to look at the text on their own computer and see the changes being made in real time.

__''Why this is important''__
There are several other ways to let everyone look at the same text. But Paratext Live not only lets everyone see the text, but it also allows more than one person to edit the text.

__''What are you going to do?''__
* Connect all users to the same network.
* Send/receive.
* Start Paratext Live and join a session
* Edit the document
* Exchange all files
* Exit Paratext Live
* Send/receive
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
See the video 4.1 Collaboration Tools.
{BOX}
----
!!20.1: Paratext Live

Before you can start Paratext Live, all users must do a send/receive and everyone must be connected to the same network.



!!!20.1.1: Send/receive

Before you start Paratext Live all participants should Send/Receive the project. Paratext will tell you that you need to Send/Receive.

!!!20.1.2: Connect to the same network

Paratext Live can use

* Internet
* a local network
* offline WiFi router
* hotspot with mobile data disabled.
!!!20.1.3: Start Paratext Live

* Open the menu for the project.
* Under __Tools__, click __Paratext Live__.
* Or use the icon on the toolbar.
* Click __Start/Join Live session__. ''If Autosave in Paratext Settings is not on, the Live session will turn it on for the duration of the session. ''
* Paratext then asks if you are the primary editor: 
** If you are __not__ the primary editor, __wait__, don’t press cancel as that will cancel your joining the live session.
** If you __are__ the primary editor, click __Start as Primary Editor__. %%%''With a session active, the Paratext Live button is green''
!!!20.1.4: Sharing changes from Tools

All scripture text is shared when you do a send/receive. However, changes made with various tools are not shared automatically. Examples of these unshared changes are to spelling status, Parallel passage status, Biblical Terms and their identified renderings, and Notes. To share these changes:

* Click the Paratext Live button on the toolbar,
* Click “__Exchange all files__” %%%''All of the users in the Paratext Live session then receive updates to these files.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Changes from all users are shared, but if two people have changed the exact same item differently, only one person’s change will be saved.
{BOX}
!!!20.1.5: End the Paratext Live session

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
__Note__: If one participant has upgraded to Paratext 9.2, __everyone__ participating needs to upgrade as Paratext Live files are slightly different in version 9.2.

__For more help__, search for '__live__' in the search box on the title bar. There are lots of useful helpful topics to help you use Paratext Live
{BOX}!__Stage 5 / Stage 3 UBS: Review by the community__

__''Introduction''__
''Note: This is equivalent to the third stage of the UBS plan.''

The fifth stage of a translation project is the review by the community. In the review you will check for naturalness, produce a team progress report and revise the key terms.



The following modules will help you in this stage:

* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 5|#PPR\:_Progress_report|21: PPR: Progress report))
* ((Paratext 9 – Stage 5|#BTR\:_Biblical_key_terms_report|22: BTR: Biblical key terms report))
!21: __PPR: Progress report__

__''Introduction''__
In this module you will create a progress report.

__''Where we are''__
As you have been working on your translation, you have been updating your project plan with your progress on completed chapters and books. Now you will prepare a project a report.

__''Why this is important''__

!22: __BTR: Biblical key terms report__

__''Introduction''__
One task in this stage is to produce a report of the changes made in the key biblical terms.

__''Where we are''__
In working on your translation you have identified and changed a number of key biblical terms.

__''Why is this important?''__
Although you can’t use Paratext to write the report, it can produce of list of the terms that you have been dealing with and may need to include in your report.

__''What are you going to do?''__
In the Biblical terms tool you will filter on the book(s) that you want to include in your report. You will then save the list of the terms as a separate HTML file. You can also filter the list on any discussion notes you may have made.

The sixth stage of a translation project (or fourth stage for UBS) is finalising for publication. Finalising a scripture portion is much simpler than finalising a New Testament or a whole Bible. This involves tasks such as adding images, extra material, checking parallel passages and a number of other final checks.

!!24.7: Check and link glossary entries

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Linking glossary items to the text is done from the Biblical Terms tool, and is usually one of the last tasks before publication to ensure that none are missed due to further corrections. If you have already linked terms it may be necessary to unlink terms before linking again.
{BOX}
* Open the Biblical Terms Tool
* Filter on __Glossary entries__
* Select one or more terms
* __≡ Tab__, under __Edit__ > __Link selected entries to the glossary __ %%%''A dialog box is displayed'' %%%{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattGyverLee/Bloom/master/12imgeng/LinkGloss1.png" class=img-responsive}
* Choose __First occurrence in every section__ %%%''A results list is displayed of each verse linked and any errors.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Warnings: It is wise to only link a few terms at a time. Be careful if there are homographs as Paratext may mistake one for the other. Also be careful when a rendering for one term is part of a phrase in another term. Also you may need to add Biblical terms for some glossary entries.
{BOX}

----
!!24.9: Check parallel passages

* See module PP: Parallel passages
!25: __PP – Compare Parallel Passages__

__''Introduction''__
There are thousands of passages in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.

__''Where we are''__
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first before comparing the texts. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.

__''Why this is important''__
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.

Normally you would make the comparisons after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.

__''What you are going to do''__
* use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
* use the check boxes to tell Paratext that you have checked the passages
* filter for any changed verses
* open a quick reference window in Paratext to see another passage while you are translating.
* open a third passage in a window at the same time.

----
!!25.5: Compare the passages

* Click on a line of references in the top pane.%%%''The texts are displayed in the bottom pane.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Text is shown in green when the text is exactly the same as in the other passage.
{BOX}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Text is shown in yellow when it has the same meaning (thought) even though it is not exactly the same as in the other passage (e.g. a different form of a verb or a synonym).
{BOX}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If the text is green in Greek, then your text should also be the same.
{BOX}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Normally, if the text is different in the Greek than it should be different in your text, but not always.
{BOX}
