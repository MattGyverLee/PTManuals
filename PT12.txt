!3: PP1 : Project Plan and progress
''Introduction''
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and to see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task, you should mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [[If you have used an earlier version of you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 8 .]''Where are we?''
Before you can use the plan, it must have been configured. [[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]''Why is this important?''
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisors and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).''What are we going to do?''
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

!5: GL: Glossary
''Introduction''
This module explains how to add entries to the glossary using the __Biblical terms__ tool.''Where we are''
You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 8. Now you will draft and enter some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.''Why this is important''
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the __Biblical terms__ tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.''What you are going to do''
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.
----

!6: BC1: Basic checks
''Introduction ''
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers using two methods: the Project plan and the Checking menu.''Where we are''
You have typed your text in Paratext 8. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks. The remaining checks are covered in ((Paratext_8_1-2_Stage2|#BC2\:_Basic_checks|12: BC2: Basic checks)) in this manual and chapter 5 in the following manual.''Why this is important''
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage.''What you are going to do''
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods.The easiest way is to run the checks from the project plan. However, you can also do the checks from the checking menu if you need to check more than one book at a time.

!9: SP: Spell Checking
''Introduction''
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into your project in Paratext 8 .''Where we are''
You have type your text in Paratext 8 and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.''Why is this important?''
It is important the correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.''What you are going to do''
Firstly you need to configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words. Then you can get Paratext 8 to show red squiggly lines under the words it does not know. You can then work through your text, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 8 that the words are correct.''What has changed in Paratext 8 ''
Paratext 8 has a number of specific checks that you can run on the wordlist. It can also highlight invalid characters in you text.
----
!!9.1: Configure the word list

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:{BOX}
!!!9.1.1: Approve the spelling of common words

In Paratext
* __Tools__ > __Wordlist__
In the Wordlist
* __Tools__ > __Approve spelling of common words__
* Enter a number
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100 but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the acuracy of the typist).{BOX}
* Click __OK__
* Click __Yes__ (to confirm that you can’t undo)
!!!9.1.2: Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect

In the Wordlist (__Tools__ > __Word List__)
* __Tools__ > __Spell Check > All checks__A list of words is displayed.
* Click on a word in the top pane.
* If the word is correct – click the green checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26.png" class=img-responsive}
* If the word is incorrect, but Paratext 8 has suggested the correct word, then click the blue link for the correct word.
* If the word is incorrect, and Paratext 8 hasn’t suggested the correct word, click on the red checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26a.png" class=img-responsive} and correct the word.
!!!9.1.3: Check similarly spelled words

In the Wordlist
* __Tools__ > __Find Similar Words__
* Enter letters which sound alike separated by / (e.g. s/sh/z)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Depending on your language, tick or untick « Ignore all diacritics when comparing words ».{BOX}
* Click __OK__ A list of words is displayed.
* Correct the words (as described above).
----
!!9.2: Spell checking – from the text

In Paratext
* __Checking__ > __Display spelling__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
A progress meter is displayed initially, then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.{BOX}
----
!!9.3: Making corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext 8 will underline in red the words that have not been approved in the word list. This either means that the word is misspelled or unknown. You must decide.{BOX}
* Right-click a word which is underlined in either red or greyA dialogue is displayed {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list
* Click __OK__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext 8 will remember the correction and you can apply the correction if it happens again.{BOX}

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed. Choose as appropriate:
__Yes__ = changes this verse and looks for the next__No__ = skips this verse and looks for the next__Yes to all__ – is too dangerous, DON’T use it__Cancel__ = stops further changes{BOX}

!10: BT: A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms
''Introduction''
The __Biblical terms rendering__ window and the separate __Biblical terms__ tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This is a process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.''Where we are''
You are translating a verse in Paratext 8 and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.''Why this is important''
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.''What you are going to do''
This method boils down to a short list of steps:
# Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
# Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
# Document why you rejected the other renderings.
# Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
* Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
----
!!10.1: Open the Biblical terms rending window

* Click in your project
* __File__ > __Open Biblical terms rendering__
* __File__ > __Select Biblical terms list__
* Choose the desired list
* Click __OK__.
----
!!10.2: [[A] Find all the ways you have rendered this term

!!!10.2.1: Find the terms for the current verse

* Is there a tick in the found column?
* If there is a tick, your verse uses the term and you can continue with the next term.
* If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).
!!!10.2.2: Add another rendering

If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:
* Select the rendering of the term in your text.
* Copy it (__Ctrl__+__c__)
* Double-click in the renderings cell.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1.png" class=img-responsive}The edit renderings dialog is displayed.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1a.png" class=img-responsive}
* Paste (__Ctrl__+__v__) the rendering in the dialog box.
* Click __OK__.
!!!10.2.3: Find other verses in the current book with the same Biblical term

* Double-click on a word in the __Term__ columnThe Biblical Terms Tool opens
* From the second filter button choose current book{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1b.png" class=img-responsive}
* Add renderings for the term from the verses until the terms in all verses are been identified (see below).
!!!10.2.4: Add renderings from the other verses

* Select the rendering in the verse
* Add the rendering using __Ctrl__+__A__
* Continue until all terms for those verses have been identified.
!!!10.2.5: Dealing with verses that don’t use the term

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example when a pronoun is used. In this case you need to deny that it is an error.{BOX}
* Click the red cross {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive} to the left of the verse reference link. The red cross turns into a green tick with a small red x {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you click on the cross by mistake, click {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive} and it will return to {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive}.{BOX}
----
!!10.3: [[B] Identify the best term

* Double-click on the term in the top pane.The edit rendering dialog is displayed listing all the renderings that have been added.

* Click __OK__
!!!10.5.1: If you need more than one rendering

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
You can add more than one rendering if appropriate. In this case it is good to add a back translation in brackets after then rendering. For example,  slave (slave) guy * work fo (guy that works for){BOX}
* Open the Edit renderings dialog box
* Edit the renderings as needed.

!11: MP: Compare a word or phrase
''Introduction''
In this module, you will search for a word or phrase in a project and compare it with the translation of that word or phrase in another project.''Why this is important?''
In Paratext 8 (and above), you can see where a word or phrase is found in one project and compare it with the equivalent word or phrase in one or more other projects. For example, you can see where "roi" is found in a French project and compare it with "rey"in a Spanish project.
You will
* use the checklist “Word or Phrase” from both the text and also from the Biblical Terms Too.
* change the settings and comparative texts
* type the word or phrase to compare for each project

!12: BC2: Basic checks
''Introduction''
In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (__Characters__, __punctuation__, __capitals__, and __repeated words__. As in the first Basic Checks module (((Paratext_8_1-2_Stage1|#BC1\:_Basic_checks|6: BC1: Basic checks))), it is easiest to run these checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the __Verification__ menu.Where are we?
You have typed your translation in Paratext 8. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in ((Paratext_8_1-2_Stage1|#BC1\:_Basic_checks|6: BC1: Basic checks)), before continuing and that your administrator has either completed the setup of the checks or is with you to do the setup now.''Why this is important?''
Paratext 8 has eleven __Basic Checks__. In ((Paratext_8_1-2_Stage1|#BC1\:_Basic_checks|6: BC1: Basic checks)), you have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to spelling, punctuation, capital letters an repeated words. Even if these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.''What we are going to do:''
Most of the checks require that a certain inventory has been completed by your administrator. In this module you will
* Confirm that the setup has been done (or have the administrator do the setup)
* do the Basic Checks
* correct any errors.
----
!!12.1: Confirm the setup

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done by your Administrator.{BOX}
The required setup may be an inventory, some rules or settings.
----
!!12.2: Using inventories to setup checks

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 8 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).{BOX}
Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.
* From the __Checking__ menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
* Click on an item in the list in the top pane.The verses are shown in the bottom pane.
* For each item in the top pane, choose either __Valid__ or __Invalid__.

!13: FC: Formatting checks
''Introduction''
In this module, you will find and correct formatting and layout errors.''Where we are''
You have typed your draft into a project in Paratext. You will use the checklists to find and correct errors related to the formatting and layout errors.''Why this is important''
A New Testament contains more than just chapters and verses. There are also titles, section headings, and several types of paragraphs. These checks allow you to be sure that the layout of your text is correct, and your titles etc. are consistent.''What are you going to do?''
You will use the checklists to
* compare your titles and section headings
* check your paragraph breaks 
* compare the paragraph markers in your text with those of your reference text
* add markers for special text formatting 
----

!14: PD: Printing Drafts
''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to print a draft of your translation for checking and revising.''Where we are''
You have entered and checked your translation in Paratext 8 and are now ready to print out a copy. Your project must be registered before you can print.''Why this is important''
It is much easier to revise and check your work on paper than on the computer. You can also give it to more people if it is on paper.''What you are going to do''
You will first produce a PDF version of your translation, which you can print or share with others (including non-Paratext users). If necessary your can copy the PDF file onto your USB stick and take it to a computer with a printer.
----
!!14.1: Create a PDF file

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Make sure you have completed a markers check before printing a draft.{BOX}
* __File__ > __Print Draft__

----
!!14.3: Copy PDF file to a USB stick

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext saves the PDF file in the PrintDrafts folder of your project folder. For example, C:\Users\User\Documents\My Paratext 8 Projects\XXX\PrintDraft
There are many ways to copy files. One method is described below.{BOX}
* Hold the Windows Key and type __E__Windows Explorer opens.

* Choose your USB stick.
!15: UN: Using Notes
''Introduction ''
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext 8 allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.''Where we are''
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Attention: Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.{BOX}''What you are going to do''
You will:
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* edit the notes and resolve notes
* open a note window from the text
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
* add rendering discussion notes to a Biblical terms list
* add spelling notes to the wordlist.

!3: PP1 : Project Plan and progress
''Introduction''
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and to see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task, you should mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [[If you have used an earlier version of you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 8 .]''Where are we?''
Before you can use the plan, it must have been configured. [[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]''Why is this important?''
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisors and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).''What are we going to do?''
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 8. Now you will draft and enter some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.''Why this is important''
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the __Biblical terms__ tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.''What you are going to do''
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.

!9: SP: Spell Checking
''Introduction''
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into your project in Paratext 8 .''Where we are''
You have type your text in Paratext 8 and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.''Why is this important?''
It is important the correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.''What you are going to do''
Firstly you need to configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words. Then you can get Paratext 8 to show red squiggly lines under the words it does not know. You can then work through your text, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 8 that the words are correct.''What has changed in Paratext 8 ''
Paratext 8 has a number of specific checks that you can run on the wordlist. It can also highlight invalid characters in you text.
----
!!9.1: Configure the word list

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:{BOX}
!!!9.1.1: Approve the spelling of common words

In Paratext
* __Tools__ > __Wordlist__
In the Wordlist
* __Tools__ > __Approve spelling of common words__
* Enter a number
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100 but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the acuracy of the typist).{BOX}
* Click __OK__
* Click __Yes__ (to confirm that you can’t undo)
!!!9.1.2: Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect

In the Wordlist (__Tools__ > __Word List__)
* __Tools__ > __Spell Check > All checks__A list of words is displayed.
* Click on a word in the top pane.
* If the word is correct – click the green checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26.png" class=img-responsive}
* If the word is incorrect, but Paratext 8 has suggested the correct word, then click the blue link for the correct word.
* If the word is incorrect, and Paratext 8 hasn’t suggested the correct word, click on the red checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26a.png" class=img-responsive} and correct the word.
!!!9.1.3: Check similarly spelled words

In the Wordlist
* __Tools__ > __Find Similar Words__
* Enter letters which sound alike separated by / (e.g. s/sh/z)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Depending on your language, tick or untick « Ignore all diacritics when comparing words ».{BOX}
* Click __OK__ A list of words is displayed.
* Correct the words (as described above).
----
!!9.2: Spell checking – from the text

In Paratext
* __Checking__ > __Display spelling__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
A progress meter is displayed initially, then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.{BOX}
----
!!9.3: Making corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext 8 will underline in red the words that have not been approved in the word list. This either means that the word is misspelled or unknown. You must decide.{BOX}
* Right-click a word which is underlined in either red or greyA dialogue is displayed {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list
* Click __OK__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext 8 will remember the correction and you can apply the correction if it happens again.{BOX}

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed. Choose as appropriate:
__Yes__ = changes this verse and looks for the next__No__ = skips this verse and looks for the next__Yes to all__ – is too dangerous, DON’T use it__Cancel__ = stops further changes{BOX}

The __Biblical terms rendering__ window and the separate __Biblical terms__ tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This is a process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.''Where we are''
You are translating a verse in Paratext 8 and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.''Why this is important''
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.''What you are going to do''
This method boils down to a short list of steps:
# Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
# Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
# Document why you rejected the other renderings.
# Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
* Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
----
!!10.1: Open the Biblical terms rending window

* Click in your project
* __File__ > __Open Biblical terms rendering__
* __File__ > __Select Biblical terms list__
* Choose the desired list
* Click __OK__.
----
!!10.2: [[A] Find all the ways you have rendered this term

!!!10.2.1: Find the terms for the current verse

* Is there a tick in the found column?
* If there is a tick, your verse uses the term and you can continue with the next term.
* If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).
!!!10.2.2: Add another rendering

If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:
* Select the rendering of the term in your text.
* Copy it (__Ctrl__+__c__)
* Double-click in the renderings cell.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1.png" class=img-responsive}The edit renderings dialog is displayed.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1a.png" class=img-responsive}
* Paste (__Ctrl__+__v__) the rendering in the dialog box.
* Click __OK__.
!!!10.2.3: Find other verses in the current book with the same Biblical term

* Double-click on a word in the __Term__ columnThe Biblical Terms Tool opens
* From the second filter button choose current book{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1b.png" class=img-responsive}
* Add renderings for the term from the verses until the terms in all verses are been identified (see below).
!!!10.2.4: Add renderings from the other verses

* Select the rendering in the verse
* Add the rendering using __Ctrl__+__A__
* Continue until all terms for those verses have been identified.
!!!10.2.5: Dealing with verses that don’t use the term

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example when a pronoun is used. In this case you need to deny that it is an error.{BOX}
* Click the red cross {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive} to the left of the verse reference link. The red cross turns into a green tick with a small red x {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you click on the cross by mistake, click {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive} and it will return to {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive}.{BOX}

!11: MP: Compare a word or phrase
''Introduction''
In this module, you will search for a word or phrase in a project and compare it with the translation of that word or phrase in another project.''Why this is important?''
In Paratext 8 (and above), you can see where a word or phrase is found in one project and compare it with the equivalent word or phrase in one or more other projects. For example, you can see where "roi" is found in a French project and compare it with "rey"in a Spanish project.
You will
* use the checklist “Word or Phrase” from both the text and also from the Biblical Terms Too.
* change the settings and comparative texts
* type the word or phrase to compare for each project 
----

!12: BC2: Basic checks
''Introduction''
In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (__Characters__, __punctuation__, __capitals__, and __repeated words__. As in the first Basic Checks module (((Paratext_8_1-2_Stage1|#BC1\:_Basic_checks|6: BC1: Basic checks))), it is easiest to run these checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the __Verification__ menu.Where are we?
You have typed your translation in Paratext 8. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in ((Paratext_8_1-2_Stage1|#BC1\:_Basic_checks|6: BC1: Basic checks)), before continuing and that your administrator has either completed the setup of the checks or is with you to do the setup now.''Why this is important?''
Paratext 8 has eleven __Basic Checks__. In ((Paratext_8_1-2_Stage1|#BC1\:_Basic_checks|6: BC1: Basic checks)), you have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to spelling, punctuation, capital letters an repeated words. Even if these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.''What we are going to do:''
Most of the checks require that a certain inventory has been completed by your administrator. In this module you will
* Confirm that the setup has been done (or have the administrator do the setup)
* do the Basic Checks
* correct any errors.
----
!!12.1: Confirm the setup

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done by your Administrator.{BOX}
The required setup may be an inventory, some rules or settings.
----
!!12.2: Using inventories to setup checks

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 8 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).{BOX}
Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.
* From the __Checking__ menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
* Click on an item in the list in the top pane.The verses are shown in the bottom pane.
* For each item in the top pane, choose either __Valid__ or __Invalid__.
* Repeat for each item.
* Click __OK__. A list of errors is displayed.
* Make any corrections as needed.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Instead of using the mouse, you can use __Ctrl__ + __y__ to mark an entry as __Valid__ or __Ctrl__ + __n__ to mark an entry as __Invalid__.{BOX}
----
!!12.3: Characters

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This inventory helps you identify all the incorrect characters, i.e. the characters which are not in your alphabet.{BOX}

* Hold the Shift and double-click
* Make the correction
* Click __OK__.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
However it is preferable to use the Wordlist or the spell checker to correct all the errors at once.{BOX}
!!!12.8.1: Review

There are many basic checks in Paratext 8. The table below summarizes the setup needed for each of the checks.
|||Check|Setup
Chapter/verse numbers |none 
Markers |Marker inventory 
Characters (Combinations) |Character inventory 
Punctuation |Punctuation inventory 
Capitalization%%%%%% %%% %%% %%% %%% |4 inventories%%% Markers Missing Final Sentence Punctuation%%%Markers followed by a lower case letter%%%Punctuation Followed by a Lower Case letter%%%Mixed Capitalization%%%

It is possible to run all the checks at the same time, however when running the checks for the first time it is better to run them one at a time to avoid large list of errors.
!13: FC: Formatting checks
''Introduction''
In this module, you will find and correct formatting and layout errors.''Where we are''
You have typed your draft into a project in Paratext. You will use the checklists to find and correct errors related to the formatting and layout errors.''Why this is important''

!14: PD: Printing Drafts
''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to print a draft of your translation for checking and revising.''Where we are''
You have entered and checked your translation in Paratext 8 and are now ready to print out a copy. Your project must be registered before you can print.''Why this is important''
It is much easier to revise and check your work on paper than on the computer. You can also give it to more people if it is on paper.''What you are going to do''
You will first produce a PDF version of your translation, which you can print or share with others (including non-Paratext users). If necessary your can copy the PDF file onto your USB stick and take it to a computer with a printer.
----
!!14.1: Create a PDF file

!15: UN: Using Notes
''Introduction ''
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext 8 allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.''Where we are''
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Attention: Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.{BOX}''What you are going to do''
You will:
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* edit the notes and resolve notes
* open a note window from the text
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
* add rendering discussion notes to a Biblical terms list
* add spelling notes to the wordlist.
