!#IS: Install Paratext 8

----
!!#Introduction

Paratext 8 is the result of a concerted effort to streamline the process of managing translation projects and accessing resources. As a result, both the data and the servers had to change. People wanted less hassle with registration and waiting for codes to be approved. They wanted access to more resources. They wanted a free version of Paratext that didn’t need a license in order to use. Now we have that in Paratext 8.
Where We are
You have already installed Paratext 7  and now want to install Paratext 8.
Why is this Important
Paratext 7 and Paratext 8 can both be installed at the same time but you need to understand the limitation of using them together.

!#MD: Migrate Data

----
!!#Introduction

Migration is the process of moving a project (including all settings files) from Paratext 7 to Paratext 8. This is similar to the process of setting up S/R for the first time in Paratext 7.x. Note: all users of a project have to migrate at the same time.
''Where We are''
You have already installed Paratext 8 and you have a Paratext 7 project that you want to use in Paratext 8.
''Why is this Important ?''
In order to get the full functionality of Paratext 8 your project needs to be migrated. Paratext 7 and Paratext 8 use different send/receive servers so there is no way for a project to be shared with some users on Paratext and some users on Paratext 8.
Users can have both Paratext 7 and Paratext 8 on their computers at the same time, and run one or the other, but no project can be shared simultaneously with users in Paratext 7 and other users in Paratext 8.
Once you have migrated the project, everyone on the team needs to get the migrated project, and only do work in Paratext 8 from then on.
You need to have a good Internet connection to migrate the project, but if you usually work without an Internet connection, you can keep working that way in Paratext 8 once the project is migrated.
''What are you going to do?''
To migrate a shared project:
* You must do a send and receive in Paratext 7 from all team members in Paratext 7 prior to migration to Paratext 8.You must do a send and receive in Paratext 7 from all team members in Paratext 7 prior to migration to Paratext 8.

Remember, no one should edit the project anymore in Paratext 7. That would be wasted effort as no one else will see their changes. To help your team members remember this, you could have them remove the project from their Paratext 7 once they have gotten it in Paratext 8. Or maybe they can uninstall Paratext 7 from their computer if they don't need it for other projects.

!!#Introduction

Starting with Paratext 8 it is a requirement that projects share their basic metadata information with the translation community. It is strongly encouraged that they share progress information [some organizations and/or donors may require this].
''Where We are?''
Paratext 8 has been installed on your computer and you have the Paratext 7 registration codes for your team members.
''Why is this Important?''
In Paratext 8 both users and projects should to be registered. Access to specific text resources, e.g. TEV, is determined by what organization you are a part of
Projects may be registered by the administrator (or a consultant serving as an administrator)
Other organizations/users are notified and may object to BoG. Basic project metadata information is available to all in ParaTExt community

In this module you will create and register a new project.
''Where We are''
You have already installed Paratext and registered a user.
''Why is this Important''
A new aspect in Paratext 8 is that projects need to be registered as well as users. This may feel like an extra complication, but it does offer benefits to users.
As we saw in the user registration section, the project administrator can create registrations for users they want to be part of their project.
''What are you going to do?''
We will create and register a new project.

!#PP1: Setup Project Plan

----
!!#Introduction

“Progress tracking” based on a Project Plan and Assignments and Progress is a new feature in Paratext 8 that will impact the day-to-day work of translation teams.
''Where We are''
Before you can add the plan the project must have been created/or migrated.
''Why is this Important''
The Project Plan feature allows the administrator to define a set of translation tasks that your translation project will follow. Paratext comes with sets of pre-defined plans from the various Bible translation organisations that you can use a starting point. However, every project is different and therefore after adding the base plan it will need to be modified for the team.
Typically, organizations want conformity at the “Stage” level in order to facilitate meaningful tracking of the progress of project across the entire organization. However, every plan will need to be customized at the task level.
If a task is important to you and your team and you want to track its progress, then it can be included in the project plan (even if it doesn't require Paratext to do the task).
''What are you going to do?''
You will use a combination of two features: the Project Plan and the Assignments and Progress (sometimes referred to as “progress tracking”) to manage the plan by assigning team members to tasks, and tracking their progress in completing those tasks.
* Add the organizational base plan to the project (remove an old plan if necessary)Add the organizational base plan to the project (remove an old plan if necessary)

!#CV: Convert project

----
!!#Introduction

If you have ever needed to rename your project, reduce the size of your project, change user names, change the encoding or struggled with composed/decomposed diacritics, then the convert project tool will help you solve these problems.
''Where We are''
You must be the administrator of the project to do these conversions.
''Why is this Important''
Although, it is possible to make some changes to existing projects through the project and setting dialogs, several major changes require that a new project is created. Using the convert project dialog allows the new project to keep the project history.
''What are you going to do?''
We will work through the six changes that can be made to your project.
* Changing the short name of the projectChanging the short name of the project
* Removing deleted files from the project historyRemoving deleted files from the project history
* Clean up Paratext Live historyClean up Paratext Live history

!#CR: Cross-references

----
!!#Introduction

Most languages do not have access to concordances and other Bible study materials in their own languages. Adding cross references to your New Testament can greatly help your reader understand the text by helping your reader find passages on similar themes.
''Where We are''
Before you can insert cross references from a model text your administrator must have created all the books (and chapters and verses) in your project. They can be empty but they must be present.
''Why is this Important''
Reading the New Testament is not like reading a novel. Having access to cross references allows your reader to find similar passages on the themes. But adding cross references one by one is too tedious. The insert cross reference feature allows you to insert all the cross references at once and also converts the book names and punctuation to match your scripture reference settings. Extracting cross-references from a model text allows you to easily insert the same cross-references.
''What are you going to do?''
We are going to do three things: export the cross reference from a model text; then make sure all the settings for book names and scripture references have been entered for your project; and finally insert the cross references.
If you don't have a model text with the desired cross-reference, you can create your own list and import it.
