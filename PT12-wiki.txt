Stage 1 : Drafting
Introduction
There are several stages in a translation project. In this first stage you will use many of the resources to ensure that you understand the source text, then you will draft and keyboard the text of the translation along with other materials and also begin the preliminary checks.
{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image2.png" class=img-responsive}
The following modules will help you in this stage :
* OB: Organising your desktop
* PP1: Project plan – the next task
* KD: Keyboarding your draft
* GL: Adding glossary items
* BC1: Basic checks – chapter/verse and markers.
* PP2 : Project plan – complete a task

Introduction
As you work with your text in Paratext you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.Where we are
We are about to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.Why this is important
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.What are you going to do?
You will start the Paratext program and open a saved combination. If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.

!3: PP1 : Project Plan and progress 
Introduction
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task you mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [If you have used an earlier version of you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 8.]Where are we?
Before you can use the plan it must have been configured.[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]Why is this important?
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisers and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).What are we going to do?
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

!10: SP : Spell Checking

||Configuring the word list |Spell checking 
Approve spelling of common words |Check the words that Paratext thinks are wrong |Check similar words |Display the red squiggly lines |Check the current book |Various checks on the word list ||Introduction
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into you project in Paratext 8.Where we are
You have type your text in Paratext and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.Why is this important?
It is important the correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.What you are going to do
Firstly you need to configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words. Then you can get Paratext to show red squiggly lines under the words it does not know. You can then work through your text, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext that the words are correct.What has changed in Paratext 8 
Paratext 8 has a number of specific checks that you can run on the wordlist. It can also highlight invalid characters in you text.
Summary
This module shows you how to:
----

!11: BT : A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms 
Introduction
The Biblical terms rendering window and the separate Biblical terms tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.Where we are
You are translating a verse in Paratext and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.Why this is important
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.What you are going to do
This method boils down to a short list of steps:
1. Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
2. Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
3. Document why you rejected the other renderings.
4. Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
In Paratext you will
1. Find the way your have rendered the term in the verse and then expand to find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
2. Choose which renderings are best, and record why.
3. Document why you rejected the other renderings.
4. Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation.
5. Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.

!16: UN : Using Notes 

||Inserting and editing notes |Resolving notes |Filtering notes |Printing notes |Checking notes ||Introduction 
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.Where we are
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.
Attention: Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.What you are going to do
You will:
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* edit the notes and resolve notes
* open a note window from the text
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
* add rendering discussion notes to a Biblical terms list
* add spelling notes to the wordlist.

Stage 1 : Drafting
Introduction
There are several stages in a translation project. In this first stage you will use many of the resources to ensure that you understand the source text, then you will draft and keyboard the text of the translation along with other materials and also begin the preliminary checks.
{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image2.png" class=img-responsive}
The following modules will help you in this stage :
* OB: Organising your desktop
* PP1: Project plan – the next task
* KD: Keyboarding your draft
* GL: Adding glossary items
* BC1: Basic checks – chapter/verse and markers.
* PP2 : Project plan – complete a task

Introduction
As you work with your text in Paratext you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.Where we are
We are about to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.Why this is important
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.What are you going to do?
You will start the Paratext program and open a saved combination. If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.

!3: PP1 : Project Plan and progress 
Introduction
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task you mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [If you have used an earlier version of you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 8.]Where are we?
Before you can use the plan it must have been configured.[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]Why is this important?
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisers and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).What are we going to do?
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

||Configuring the word list |Spell checking 
Approve spelling of common words |Check the words that Paratext thinks are wrong |Check similar words |Display the red squiggly lines |Check the current book |Various checks on the word list ||Introduction
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into you project in Paratext 8.Where we are
You have type your text in Paratext and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.Why is this important?
It is important the correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.What you are going to do
Firstly you need to configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words. Then you can get Paratext to show red squiggly lines under the words it does not know. You can then work through your text, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext that the words are correct.What has changed in Paratext 8 
Paratext 8 has a number of specific checks that you can run on the wordlist. It can also highlight invalid characters in you text.
Summary
This module shows you how to:

!11: BT : A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms 
Introduction
The Biblical terms rendering window and the separate Biblical terms tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.Where we are
You are translating a verse in Paratext and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.Why this is important
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.What you are going to do
This method boils down to a short list of steps:
1. Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
2. Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
3. Document why you rejected the other renderings.
4. Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
In Paratext you will
1. Find the way your have rendered the term in the verse and then expand to find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
2. Choose which renderings are best, and record why.
3. Document why you rejected the other renderings.
4. Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation.
5. Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.

!16: UN : Using Notes 

||Inserting and editing notes |Resolving notes |Filtering notes |Printing notes |Checking notes ||Introduction 
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.Where we are
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.
Attention: Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.What you are going to do
You will:
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* edit the notes and resolve notes
* open a note window from the text
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
* add rendering discussion notes to a Biblical terms list
* add spelling notes to the wordlist.
