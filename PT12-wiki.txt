!Intro and Stage 1

!#Introduction 

----
!!#Goal 

The participants will process their translation with the help of Paratext 8, a program created for entering, storing, and checking the translated texts. They will also print drafts for revision. The course will explain the procedures and will also highlight any differences between Paratext 7.5 et 8.
----
!!#Course Objectives 

At the end of the course, the participant will be able to:
''Start Paratext ''
* Start the Paratext program using a desktop icon.
Stage 1 : Drafting
''Open projects and resources to understand the text before translating''
* Open projects and additional resources, for example an English Bible, a source text, a source text dictionary etc.
* Organise these windows on the screen and save as a text combination.
''Enter the translation''
* Effectively use the navigation toolbar to move to the desired book, chapter, and verse.
* Type the text in an open project with the help of USFM markers such as \c, \v, etc. in an suitable view.
* Use a keyboarding system (MS-keyboards or Keyman) to type special characters.
* Add additional markers for section headings, introductions etc.
* Add footnotes.
* Draft glossary entries and add using the Biblical terms tool.
* Use the Send/Receive feature to share and backup their project to the Internet or a USB key.
''Basic checks''
* Run the chapter/verses check to make sure that all the chapters/verses are present.
* Run the markers check to make sure all the text has the correct markers.
''Project progress''
* Update the project plan with any completed tasks.
Stage 2 : Team checking
''Proper names''
* Transliterate proper names.
* Check that proper names are consistent.
''Biblical terms consistent''
* Use the Biblical terms rendering window and tool to ensure you are consistent in the use of terms.
''Checks''
* Use Checklists to correct any formatting problems in section breaks and headings, paragraph breaks, layout and indents.
* Run various checks to make sure all the characters, punctuation, capitalisation and repeated words are valid. (Administrators need to setup the inventories/settings as required).
* Correct any spelling mistakes using the spell checking function and/or checks from the Wordlist.
''Using notes''
* Add project notes as needed to communicate with other team members and/or consultants.
* Add project, Spelling and Biblical term notes to discuss various issues and record the decisions made.
''Print draft''
* Produce and print PDF file for reviewers.
Introductions, setup
''Introduce yourself''
The participant and facilitators should introduce themselves giving:
* their name
* their language
* their town
* what was the first and last (most recent) version of Paratext that you have used.
||5.0 |6.0 |6.1 |6.2 |7.0 |7.1 |7.2 |7.3 |7.4 |7.5 
1998 |2003 | | |2008 |2010 |2011 |2012 |2013 |2014 ||
While the facilitators install Paratext on the computers, the participant should read the introductory material and tick (check) the objectives that they feel confident doing in the most recent version of Paratext they have used.
''For each module''
* Do a revision activity of the previous module.
* Present the introduction (read, sketch, PowerPoint, etc.)
* If a skill is quite simple, ask a participant to come and demonstrate the skill.
* Follow the summary for the other skills:
* Demonstration
* Do it together
* Let the participants redo it themselves
* Ask a participant to demonstrate the skill.
* Ask questions.
* Do a revision activity.
* Give the participant time to reflect, fill in the recall exercise, add to Anki.
Stage 1 : Drafting
Introduction
There are several stages in a translation project. In this first stage you will use many of the resources to ensure that you understand the source text, then you will draft and keyboard the text of the translation along with other materials and also begin the preliminary checks.
{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image2.png" class=img-responsive}
The following modules will help you in this stage :
* OB: Organising your desktop
* PP1: Project plan – the next task
* KD: Keyboarding your draft
* GL: Adding glossary items
* BC1: Basic checks – chapter/verse and markers.
* PP2 : Project plan – complete a task
!#OD : Organising your desktop 

||Start %%%Paratext |Use combinations of windows |Open your project |Open resources (source text, texts collection…) |Create a list of verses from the source text ||
Introduction
As you work with your text in Paratext you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.
''Where we are''
We are about to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.
''Why this is important''
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.
''What are you going to do?''
You will start the Paratext program and open a saved combination. If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.

!#PP1 : Project Plan and progress 

Introduction
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task you mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [If you have used an earlier version of you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 8.]
''Where are we?''
Before you can use the plan it must have been configured. [This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]
''Why is this important?''
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisers and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).
''What are we going to do?''
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

Introduction
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers.
''Where we are''
You have typed your text in Paratext. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks.
''Why this is important''
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it.
''What you are going to do''
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods.
* In Paratext 8 the easiest way to run check is from the project plan.
* It is also possible to do the checks from the checking menu. You use this method if you need to run the checks on more than one book at a time.

Introduction
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into you project in Paratext 8.
''Where we are''
You have type your text in Paratext and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.
''Why is this important?''
It is important the correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.
''What you are going to do''
Firstly you need to configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words. Then you can get Paratext to show red squiggly lines under the words it does not know. You can then work through your text, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext that the words are correct.
''What has changed in Paratext 8 ''
Paratext 8 has a number of specific checks that you can run on the wordlist. It can also highlight invalid characters in you text.
Summary
This module shows you how to:
----
!!#Configure the word list

Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:
!!!#Approve the spelling of common words [◙ VO01a] 

In Paratext
* Tools > Wordlist
In the Wordlist
* Tools > Approve spelling of common words
* Enter a number
The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100 but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the acuracy of the typist).
* Click OK
* Click Yes (to confirm that you can’t undo)
!!!#Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect [◙ VO01b] 

In the Wordlist
* Tools > Check spelling
A list of words is displayed.
* Tools > Spell check > All checks
* Click on a word in the top pane.
* If the word is correct – click the green checkbox
* {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* If the word is incorrect, but Paratext has suggested the correct word, then click the blue link for the correct word.
* If the word is incorrect, and Paratext hasn’t suggested the correct word, click on the red checkbox X and correct the word.
!!!#Check similarly spelled words [◙ VO01c] 

In the Wordlist
* Tools > Find Similar Words
* Enter letters which sound alike separated by / (e.g. s/sh/z)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Depending on your language, tick or untick « Ignore all diacritics when comparing words ».{BOX}
* Click OK
A list of words is displayed.
* Correct the words (as described above).
Spell checking – from the text
----
!!#Spell checking [◙ VO02] 

In Paratext
* Checking > Display spelling
A progress meter is displayed initially then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.
----
!!#Making corrections [◙ VO02] 

* {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list
* Click OK
When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext will remember the correction and can apply the correction if it happens again.
When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed. Choose as appropriate: Yes = changes this verse and looks for the nextNo = skips this verse and looks for the nextYes to all – is too dangerous, DON’T use itCancel = stops changing any more
Spell checking – current book
----
!!#Spell checking - current book


!!!#Spell checking – current book [◙ VO02b] 

* Checking > Spell Check Current Book
A window appears with a list of some words in the current book.

!#BT : A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms

''Introduction''
The Biblical terms rendering window and the separate Biblical terms tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.
''Where we are''
You are translating a verse in Paratext and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.
''Why this is important''
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.
''What you are going to do''
This method boils down to a short list of steps:
1. Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
2. Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
3. Document why you rejected the other renderings.
4. Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
In Paratext you will
1. Find the way your have rendered the term in the verse and then expand to find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
2. Choose which renderings are best, and record why.
3. Document why you rejected the other renderings.
4. Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation.
5. Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
Summary
This module shows you how to:
----
!!#Open the Biblical terms rending window [◙ VT01] 

* Click in your project
* File > Open Biblical terms rendering
* File > Select Biblical terms list
* Choose the desired list
* Click OK.
----
!!#Find the terms for the current verse

* If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).
----
!!#Add another rendering 

If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:
* Select the rendering of the term in your text.
* Copy it (ctrl+c)
* Double-click in the renderings cell.

''Why this is important''
A New Testament contains more than just chapters and verses. There are also titles, section headings, and several types of paragraphs. These checks allow you to be sure that the layout of your text is correct, and your titles etc. are consistent.
''What you are going to do''
You will use the checklists to
* compare your titles and section headings
* check your paragraph breaks
* compare the paragraph markers in your text with those of your reference text

!#BC2 : Basic checks

||Setup |Using %%%Inventories |Basic %%%checks ||
Introduction
In this module you will learn how to run several more basic checks (characters, punctuation, capitalisation and repeated words). As in the first module, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.
''Where we are''
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers as described in module BC1 before continuing.
''Why this is important''
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first two (chapter/verses and markers). The next set of checks help you find errors related the characters, punctuation, capitalisation, repeated words. Although these errors may not affect the content of the text is makes the text easier to read.
''What you are going to do''
Most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:
* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.
Summary
This module shows you how to:
----
!!#Confirm the setup 

Note: Before you can run the other basic checks some form of setup must be done by your Administrator.
The setup may be either an inventory, rules or settings.
----
!!#Using inventories to setup checks [◙ VT02] 

These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).
Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.
* From the Checking menu, choose the appripriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
* Click on an element in the list in the top pane.
The verses are shown in the bottom pane.
* For each element in the top pane, choose either Valid or Non valid.
* Repeat for the next element.
* Click OK when finished.
Details for the checks
----
!!#Characters [◙ VT02] 

This inventory helps you identify all the incorrect characters, i.e. the characters which are not in your alphabet.
* Checking > Character inventory
* For each element, choose either Valid or Non valid.
* Click OK
* Checking > Run Basic Checks
* Check « Characters »
* Click OK.
* Make any corrections as needed.
----
!!#Punctuation [◙ VT03] 

Identify all the incorrect or misplaced punctuation marks. (Use the Unicode character column to clearly identify the punctuation.)
* Checking > Punctuation Inventory
* Check each punctuation mark and its context.
The contexts can be: word initial, word medial, word final or isolated (space before and after).
{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image41.png" class=img-responsive}
* Checking > Run Basic Checks
* Click beside « Punctuation»
* Click OK.
* Make any corrections as needed.
----
!!#Repeated words [◙ VT05] 

This check finds the words which have been immediately repeated in the text.
* Checking > Repeated words inventory:
* For each item on the list, choose Valid or Non valid.
* Checking > Run Basic Checks
* Check « Repeated words »
* Click OK.
* Make any corrections as needed.
----
!!#Capitalization [◙ VT06] 

There are four inventories needed for the capitalisation check but only one check. You may need to click the Options button to add markers or punctuation.
* Checking> Markers Missing Final Sentence Punctuation
* Checking> Markers followed by a lower case letter
* Checking>Punctuation Followed by a Lower Case letter
* Checking> Mixed Capitalization
* For each item on the list, choose Valid or Non valid.
* Checking > Run Basic Checks
* Check « Capitalization »
* Click OK.
* Make any corrections as needed.
----
!!#Making minor corrections 

It is possible to make minor corrections from within a displayed inventory.
* Click on a verse in the low pane
* Hold the Shift and double-click
* Make the correction
* Click OK.
However it is preferable to use the wordlist or the spell checker to correct all the errors at once.
!!!#Revision

There are many basic checks in Paratext 8. The table below summarizes the setup needed for each of the checks.
||Check |Setup 
Chapter/verse numbers |none 
Markers |Marker inventory 
Characters (Combinations) |Character inventory 
Punctuation |Punctuation inventory 
Capitalization |4 inventories%%% Markers Missing Final Sentence Punctuation%%%Markers followed by a lower case letter%%%Punctuation Followed by a Lower Case letter%%%Mixed Capitalization%%% 
Repeated words |Repeated words inventory 
Unmatched pairs of punctuation |Unmatched pairs of punctuation inventory 
Quotations |Quotation rules (from Checking menu) 
Numbers |Number settings (from checking menu) 
References |Scripture reference settings (from project menu) 
Quoted text |none ||
It is possible to run all the checks at the same time, however when running the checks for the first time it is better to run them one at a time to avoid large list of errors.
!#UN : Using Notes 

||Inserting and editing notes |Resolving notes |Filtering notes |Printing notes |Checking notes ||
Introduction
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.
''Where we are''
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.
Attention : Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.
''What you are going to do''
You will
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* edit the notes and resolve notes
* open a note window from the text
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
* add rendering discussion notes to a Biblical terms list
* add spelling notes to the wordlist.
----
!!#Different types of project notes 

You can choose from many different icons for your project notes in Paratext :
