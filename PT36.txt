!Course Introduction

!1: Introduction

----
!!1.1: Goal

The participants will process their translation with the help of Paratext, a program created for entering, storing, and checking the translated texts. The course follows the six stages of translation as given in the SIL base organisational plan. [[The four stages of the UBS plan are 1, 2, 5, and 6] There are three manuals in the series. The first deals with tasks that require an administrator. The second covers the first two stages (Stage 1-2). This manual covers the last stages 3-6 (or 3-4 of UBS).
----
!!1.2: Course Objectives

At the end of the course, the participant will be able to:''Stage 3: Prepare for a consultant check''
* Prepare a back translation
* Back translation 1 (free)
* Back translation 2 (word by word)
* Complete other checks
* check references, quoted texts, numbering, unmatched pairs of punctuation, quotations

!2: BT1: Draft a Back Translation
''Introduction''
This module explains how to draft a back translation into a separate Paratext project and keep it up-to-date. [[The next module will explain how to do a word by word gloss of the translation using the project interlinearizer.]''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.''Why is this important?''
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term “back translation” comes from. The consult will use this translation to help your team improve your exegetical choices in the text.
It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.''What will you do?''
* Open your project and back translation project
* Arrange your text on the screen.
* Draft your back translation
* Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
* Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.

!3: BT2: Interlinearise a project
''Introduction''
The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Please note that in Paratext 8 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.{BOX}''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word for word back translation. [[This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]''Why this is important''
Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.''What you will do''
You will use the project interlineariser to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will setup the interlineariser, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can export it to the back translation project.
----
!!3.1: Create a new project for the back translation

(First time only by Administrator)
* __File__ > __New Project__

!4: Compare Text
''Introduction ''
In this module, you will learn how to save old versions of your text and review them later.''Where are we? ''
You have worked on your text and you have arrived at an important stage of your project.''Why is this important?''
As you work on your translation, you are continually making changes. It is good to have a copy of the previous version of your text, for example the text as it was before you went to a consultant check. You can do this by marking a point in the history of your project. After marking a point in the history, you can compare the version at that point with the current version.''What will you do?''
You will mark a point in the history of the project which you can go back to later and compare your work
----
!!4.1: Mark Point in History

* Click in your project window to make it active (in Paratext).
* From the __Project __ menu choose __Mark a point in project history.__
* Type a comment to describe the point.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: It is good to start the comment with some symbols, such as ###, to be able to find the point in the long list.{BOX}
* Click __OK__

!5: BC3: Basic checks 3
''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.''Where we are''
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules BC1 and BC2 before continuing. And that either your administrator has done the setup for the checks or is available to do the setup with you.''Why this is important''
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks helps you find errors related to material referred from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.''What you are going to do''
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:
* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.
----
!!5.1: Unmatched pairs of Punctuation

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check looks at punctuation that occurs in pairs (opening and closing) and lists errors where it is not matched by the other half of the pair. This may be deliberate but is more likely to be an error, e.g. ( ), [[ ], etc.{BOX}
!!!5.1.1: Setup - inventory

* __Checking__ > __Unmatched pairs of punctuation__:If the list is empty, then there are no errors.
* If necessary, click __Options...__ to add other pairs.

!9: PP: Compare Parallel Passages
''Introduction''
There are thousands of passages in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.''Where we are''
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first before comparing the texts. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.''Why this is important''
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.
Normally you would make the comparisons after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.''What you are going to do''
* use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
* use the check boxes to tell Paratext that you have checked the passages
* filter for any changed verses
* open a quick reference window in Paratext to see another passage while you are translating.
* open a third passage in a window.
----
!!9.1: Open the Parallel passages window

!2: BT1: Draft a Back Translation
''Introduction''
This module explains how to draft a back translation into a separate Paratext project and keep it up-to-date. [[The next module will explain how to do a word by word gloss of the translation using the project interlinearizer.]''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.''Why is this important?''
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term “back translation” comes from. The consult will use this translation to help your team improve your exegetical choices in the text.
It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.''What will you do?''
* Open your project and back translation project
* Arrange your text on the screen.
* Draft your back translation
* Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
* Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.

!3: BT2: Interlinearise a project
''Introduction''
The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Please note that in Paratext 8 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.{BOX}''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word for word back translation. [[This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]''Why this is important''
Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.''What you will do''
You will use the project interlineariser to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will setup the interlineariser, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can export it to the back translation project.
----
!!3.1: Create a new project for the back translation

(First time only by Administrator)
* __File__ > __New Project__
* Click ______Edition__
* Type a full name for the project and a short name

!4: Compare Text
''Introduction ''
In this module, you will learn how to save old versions of your text and review them later.''Where are we? ''
You have worked on your text and you have arrived at an important stage of your project.''Why is this important?''
As you work on your translation, you are continually making changes. It is good to have a copy of the previous version of your text, for example the text as it was before you went to a consultant check. You can do this by marking a point in the history of your project. After marking a point in the history, you can compare the version at that point with the current version.''What will you do?''
You will mark a point in the history of the project which you can go back to later and compare your work
----
!!4.1: Mark Point in History

* Click in your project window to make it active (in Paratext).
* From the __Project __ menu choose __Mark a point in project history.__
* Type a comment to describe the point.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: It is good to start the comment with some symbols, such as ###, to be able to find the point in the long list.{BOX}

!5: BC3: Basic checks 3
''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.''Where we are''
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules BC1 and BC2 before continuing. And that either your administrator has done the setup for the checks or is available to do the setup with you.''Why this is important''
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks helps you find errors related to material referred from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.''What you are going to do''
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:
* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.
----
!!5.1: Unmatched pairs of Punctuation

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check looks at punctuation that occurs in pairs (opening and closing) and lists errors where it is not matched by the other half of the pair. This may be deliberate but is more likely to be an error, e.g. ( ), [[ ], etc.{BOX}

!9: PP: Compare Parallel Passages
''Introduction''
There are thousands of passages in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.''Where we are''
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first before comparing the texts. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.''Why this is important''
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.
Normally you would make the comparisons after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.''What you are going to do''
* use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
* use the check boxes to tell Paratext that you have checked the passages
* filter for any changed verses
* open a quick reference window in Paratext to see another passage while you are translating.
* open a third passage in a window.
