* spell checking
''Stage 4: Consultant Check''
All the tasks for this step have been covered in previous modules.
''Stage 5: Community testing''
* Prepare a progress report.
* Prepare a Biblical terms report.
''Stage 6: Finalising for publication''
* Add illustrations et captions
* Identify the names for any maps to be included.
* Add an introduction to the NT / Bible
* Compare the parallel passages
* Confirm that all the other checks have been completed.
* Finalize check of proper names.
* Check numbers, money, weights and measures
* Final format checks.
Stage 3: Preparing for the Consultant check
''Introduction''
In this third stage of a translation project you will do comprehension testing and back translation. You will also continue with the basic checks and spell checking.

!#BT1: Draft a Back translation

||Create a new project %%%for the back translation%%%(first time only) |Draft the back translation |Mark a chapter as finished |Viewing differences |Project plan ||
''''Introduction
This module explains how to draft a back translation into a separate ParaTExt project and keep it up-to-date. [The next module will explain how to do a word by word gloss of the translation using the project interlinearizer.]
''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in ParaTExt and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.
''Why is this important?''
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term back translation comes from. The consult will use this translation to help the team improve your exegetical choices in the text.
It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.
''What will you do?''
* Open your project and back translation project
* Arrange your text on the screen.
* Draft your back translation
* Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
* Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.

!#BT2: Interlinearise a project

||Create a new project for %%%the second back translation %%%(first time only) |Setup project interlineariser |Correct glosses |Exporter / approve the verses ||
''Introduction''
The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function. Please note that in Paratext 8 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.
''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in ParaTExt and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word for word back translation. [This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]
''Why this is important''
Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.
''What you will do''
You will use the project interlineariser to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will setup the interlineariser, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can export it to the back translation project.

!#BC3: Basic checks 3

''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.
''Where we are''
You have typed your translation into ParaTExt. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules BC1 and BC2 before continuing.
''Why this is important''
ParaTExt has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks help you find errors related to material refered from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.
''What you are going to do''
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:
* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.
''Summary''
This module shows you how to:
----
!!#Unmatched pairs of Punctuation [◙ VT04]

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check looks at punctuation that occurs in pairs (opening and closing) and lists errors where it is not matched by the other half of the pair. This may be deliberate but is more likely to be an error, e.g. ( ), [ ], etc.{BOX}

-----------------------------------


!Stage 4: Consultant Visit

''Introduction''
The fourth stage of a translation project is the consultant visit. You will meet with the consultant and evaluate your text, make notes and revise your texts and back translations as needed. You will want to ensure that you have updated the status of your translation in the project plan.
{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/36imgeng/image21.png" class=img-responsive}
All tasks in this stage have been covered in previous modules.

!#PP: Compare parallel passages

''Introduction''
There are thousands of passage in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.
''Where we are''
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.
''Why this is important''
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.
Normally you would make the comparisons made after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.
''What you are going to do''
* use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
* use the check boxes to tell ParaTExt that you have checked the passages
* filter for changed verses
* open a quick reference window in ParaTExt to see another passage while you are translating.
''Summary''
This module shows you how to:
