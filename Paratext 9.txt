''Introduction''
There are several stages in a translation project. In this first stage you will use many of the resources to ensure that you understand the source text, then you will draft and keyboard the text of the translation along with other materials and also begin the preliminary checks.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image2.png" class=img-responsive}
The following modules will help you in this stage :
* ((OD – Organising your desktop|OD – Organising your desktop))
* ((PP1 – Project plan and progress|PP1 – Project plan and progress))
* ((KD – Keyboarding your draft|KD – Keyboarding your draft))
* ((GL – Glossary|GL – Glossary))
* ((BC1 – Basic checks|BC1 – Basic checks))
* ((PP2 – Project progress|PP2 – Project progress))
!2: __OD – Organising your desktop__
''Introduction''
As you work with your text in Paratext 9 you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.''Where we are''
We are about to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.''Why this is important''
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.''What are you going to do?''
You will start the Paratext 9 program and open a previously saved text combination. If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.
''Changes in Paratext 9''
The menus have changed in Paratext 9.To see the menu you now need to click on the menu icon ≡. There are now two types of menus. The main Paratext menu is on the title bar ({img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgfr/IconParatextMenu.png" class=img-responsive}) and each window (or tab) has its own menu ({img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgfr/Iconprojmenu.png" class=img-responsive}). When you click on one of these menu icons all the menus are displayed and you just need to click on the command.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
In the manual, when it says __≡ Paratext__, __Menu__ > __Command__. It means click on the Paratext menu icon ≡, then under the menu (e.g. File) choose the command (e.g. Open). And when it says __≡ Tab__, __Menu__ > __Command__ it means click on the tab menu icon, then under the menu (e.g. Tools) click on the command (e.g. Wordlist){BOX}

!3: __PP1 – Project plan and progress__ {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/pt9.png" class=img-responsive}
''Introduction''
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and to see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task, you should mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [[If you have used an earlier version you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 9 .]''Where are we?''
Before you can use the plan, it must have been configured. [[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]''Why is this important?''
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisors and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).''What are we going to do?''
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

!5: GL – Glossary
''Introduction''
This module explains how to add entries to the glossary using the __Biblical terms__ tool.''Where we are''
You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 9. Now you will draft and enter some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.''Why this is important''
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the __Biblical terms__ tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.''What you are going to do''
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.

!6: BC1 – Basic checks
''Introduction ''
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers using two methods: the Project plan and the Checking menu.''Where we are''
You have typed your text in Paratext 9. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks. The remaining checks are covered in ((BC2 – Basic Checks|BC2 – Basic Checks)) in this manual and chapter 5 in the following manual.''Why this is important''
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage.''What you are going to do''
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods.The easiest way is to run the checks from the project plan. However, you can also do the checks from the __checking__ menu if you need to check more than one book at a time.
----

!9: SP – Spell Checking
''Introduction''
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into your project in Paratext 9 .''Where we are''
You have typed your text in Paratext 9 and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.''Why is this important?''
It is important to correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.''What you are going to do''
Firstly you need to configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words. Then you can get Paratext 9 to show red squiggly lines under the words it does not know. You can then work through your text, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 9 that the words are correct.
----
!!9.1: Configure the word list

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:{BOX}
!!!9.1.1: Approve the spelling of common words

In Paratext
* __≡ Tab__, sous __Tools__ > __Wordlist__
In the Wordlist
* __Tools__ > __Approve spelling of common words__
* Enter a number
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100 but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the acuracy of the typist).{BOX}
* Click __OK__
* Click __Yes__ (to confirm that you can’t undo)
!!!9.1.2: Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect

In the Wordlist (__Tools__ > __Word List__)
* __Tools__ > __Spell Check > All checks__A list of words is displayed.
* Click on a word in the top pane.
* If the word is correct – click the green checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26.png" class=img-responsive}
* If the word is incorrect, but Paratext 9 has suggested the correct word, then click the blue link for the correct word.
* If the word is incorrect, and Paratext 9 hasn’t suggested the correct word, click on the red checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26a.png" class=img-responsive} and correct the word. (See 9.3)
!!!9.1.3: Check similarly spelled words

In the Wordlist
* __Tools__ > __Find Similar Words__
* Enter letters which sound alike separated by / (e.g. s/sh/z)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Depending on your language, tick or untick “Ignore all diacritics when comparing words”.{BOX}
* Click __OK__ A list of words is displayed.
* Correct the words (as described above).
----
!!9.2: Spell checking – from the text

In Paratext
* __Checking__ > __Display spelling__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
A progress meter is displayed initially, then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.{BOX}
----
!!9.3: Making corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext 9 will underline in red the words that have not been approved in the word list. This either means that the word is misspelled or unknown.{BOX}
* Right-click a word which is underlined in either red or greyA dialogue is displayed {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list
* Click __OK__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext 9 will remember the correction and you can apply the correction if it happens again.{BOX}

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed. Choose as appropriate:
__Yes__ = changes this verse and looks for the next__No__ = skips this verse and looks for the next__Yes to all__ – is too dangerous, DON’T use it__Cancel__ = stops further changes{BOX}

!10: BT – A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms
''Introduction''
The __Biblical terms rendering__ window and the separate __Biblical terms__ tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This is a process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.''Where we are''
You are translating a verse in Paratext 9 and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.''Why this is important''
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.''What you are going to do''
This method boils down to a short list of steps:
# [[A] Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
# [[B] Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
# [[C] Document why you rejected the other renderings.
# [[D] Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
* Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
----
!!10.1: Open the Biblical terms rending window

* Click in your project
* __File__ > __Open Biblical terms rendering__
* __File__ > __Select Biblical terms list__
* Choose the desired list
* Click __OK__.
----
!!10.2: [[A] Find all the ways you have rendered this term

!!!10.2.1: Find the terms for the current verse

* Is there a tick in the found column?
* If there is a tick, your verse uses the term and you can continue with the next term.
* If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).
!!!10.2.2: Add another rendering

If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:
* Select the rendering of the term in your text.
* Copy it (__Ctrl__+__C__)
* Double-click in the renderings cell.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1.png" class=img-responsive}The edit renderings dialog is displayed.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1a.png" class=img-responsive}
* Paste (__Ctrl__+__V__) the rendering in the dialog box.
* Click __OK__.
!!!10.2.3: Find other verses in the current book with the same Biblical term

* Double-click on a word in the __Term__ columnThe Biblical Terms Tool opens
* From the second filter button choose __current book__{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1b.png" class=img-responsive}
* Add renderings for the term from the verses until the terms in all verses are been identified (see below).
!!!10.2.4: Add renderings from the other verses

* Select the rendering in the verse
* Add the rendering using __Ctrl__+__A__
* Continue until all terms for those verses have been identified.
!!!10.2.5: Dealing with verses that don’t use the term

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example when a pronoun is used. In this case you need to deny that it is an error.{BOX}
* Click the red cross {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive} to the left of the verse reference link.

In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (__Characters__, __punctuation__, __capitals__, and __repeated words__. As in the first Basic Checks module (((BC1 – Basic checks|BC1 – Basic checks))), it is easiest to run these checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the __Verification__ menu.Where are we?
You have typed your translation in Paratext 9. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in ((BC1 – Basic checks|BC1 – Basic checks)), before continuing and that your administrator has either completed the setup of the checks or is with you to do the setup now.''Why this is important?''
Paratext 9 has eleven __Basic Checks__. In ((BC1 – Basic checks|BC1 – Basic checks)), you have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to spelling, punctuation, capital letters an repeated words. Even if these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.''What we are going to do:''
Most of the checks require that a certain inventory has been completed by your administrator. In this module you will
* Confirm that the setup has been done (or have the administrator do the setup)
* do the Basic Checks
* correct any errors.
----
!!12.1: Confirm the setup

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done. Some checks require an inventory others require settings. You can do most of the inventories, but only your Administrator can do the settings.{BOX}
The required setup may be an inventory, some rules or settings.
----
!!12.2: Using inventories to setup checks

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 9 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).{BOX}
Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.
* From the __Checking__ menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
* Click on an item in the list in the top pane.The verses are shown in the bottom pane.
* For each item in the top pane, choose either __Valid__ or __Invalid__.
* Repeat for each item.
* Click __OK__.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Instead of using the mouse, you can use __Ctrl__ + __y__ to mark an entry as __Valid__ or __Ctrl__ + __n__ to mark an entry as __Invalid__.{BOX}
----
!!12.3: Characters

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check (and inventory) helps you identify all the incorrect characters, i.e. the characters which are not in your alphabet.{BOX}

----
!!12.8: Making minor corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
It is possible to make minor corrections from within a displayed inventory. However, if there are several errors it is best to run the check to make the corrections.{BOX}
* Click on a verse in the lower pane
* Hold the Shift and double-click
* Make the correction
* Click __OK__.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
In some cases it is preferable to use the Wordlist or the spell checker to several errors at once.{BOX}
!!!12.8.1: Review

There are many basic checks in Paratext 9. The table below summarizes the setup needed for each of the checks.
|||Check|Setup
Chapter/verse numbers |none 
Markers |Marker inventory 
Characters (Combinations) |Character inventory 
Punctuation |Punctuation inventory 
Capitalization%%%%%% %%% %%% %%% %%% |4 inventories%%% Markers Missing Final Sentence Punctuation%%%Markers followed by a lower case letter%%%Punctuation Followed by a Lower Case letter%%%Mixed Capitalization%%%

Unmatched pairs of punctuation |Unmatched pairs of punctuation inventory 
Quotations |Quotation rules (from Checking menu) 
Numbers |Number settings (from checking menu) 
References |Scripture reference settings (from project menu) 
Quoted text |none ||
It is possible to run all the checks at the same time, however when running the checks for the first time it is better to run them one at a time to avoid large list of errors.
!13: FC – Formatting checks
''Introduction''
In this module, you will find and correct formatting and layout errors.''Where we are''
You have typed your draft into a project in Paratext. You will use the checklists to find and correct errors related to the formatting and layout errors.''Why this is important''
A New Testament contains more than just chapters and verses. There are also titles, section headings, and several types of paragraphs. These checks allow you to be sure that the layout of your text is correct, and your titles etc. are consistent.''What are you going to do?''
You will use the checklists to
* compare your titles and section headings
* check your paragraph breaks 
* compare the paragraph markers in your text with those of your reference text
* add markers for special text formatting.

!14: PD – Printing Drafts
''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to print a draft of your translation for checking and revising.''Where we are''
You have entered and checked your translation in Paratext 9 and are now ready to print out a copy. Your project must be registered before you can print.''Why this is important''
It is much easier to revise and check your work on paper than on the computer. You can also give it to more people if it is on paper.''What you are going to do''
You will first produce a PDF version of your translation, which you can print or share with others (including non-Paratext users). If necessary your can copy the PDF file onto your USB stick and take it to a computer with a printer.
----
!!14.1: Create a PDF file

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Make sure you have completed a markers check before printing a draft.{BOX}
* __≡ project__, under __File__ > __Export Draft PDF__
* Check that your project is selected.
* Choose which book(s) and chapters to print.
* Choose the page settings as follows :
* Page size: 210mm, 297mm (A4) ou 148mm, 210mm (A5)
* Columns : 1
* Margins : 25 mm  (for A4) or 12 mm  (for A5)

* Click __OK__ and wait, the file will open in your PDF reader.If there are marker errors, a message box will appear. Click No, then correct the errors and try again.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: The first time you print a draft it takes a long time collecting information on the fonts. But it will be much quicker the next time.{BOX}
----
!!14.2: Print a PDF

In Adobe Reader
* (Make sure the PDF file is open.)
* __File__ > __Print.__
* For A5
* Choose __Booklet__
* Orientation : portrait (for newer printers or landscape for Win7)
* To print double-sided
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you want to follow a punctuation system (such as French) and have spaces automatically inserted before complex punctuation, then see a consultant to have changes made to your PrintDraftChanges.txt{BOX}
----
!!14.3: Copy PDF file to a USB stick

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext saves the PDF file in the PrintDrafts folder of your project folder. For example, C:\My Paratext 9 Projects\XXX\PrintDraft
There are many ways to copy files. One method is described below.{BOX}
* Hold the Windows Key and type __E__Windows Explorer opens.
* Go to your __My Paratext 8 Projects__ folder.
* Double-click on your project folder
* Double-click the __PrintDraft__ folder
* Right-click on the desired PDF file
* Choose __Send to__
* Choose your USB stick.
!15: UN – Using Notes
''Introduction ''
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext 9 allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.''Where we are''
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Attention: Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.{BOX}''What you are going to do''
You will:
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* edit the notes and resolve notes
* open a note window from the text
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
* add rendering discussion notes to a Biblical terms list
* add spelling notes to the wordlist.

!16: BT1 – Draft a Back Translation
''Introduction''
This module explains how to draft a back translation into a separate Paratext project and keep it up-to-date. [[The next module will explain how to do a word by word gloss of the translation using the project interlinearizer.]''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.''Why is this important?''
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term “back translation” comes from. The consult will use this translation to help your team improve your exegetical choices in the text.
It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.''What will you do?''
* Open your project and back translation project
* Arrange your text on the screen.
* Draft your back translation
* Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
* Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.

!17: BT2 – Interlinearise a project
''Introduction''
The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Please note that in Paratext 9 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.{BOX}''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word for word back translation. [[This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]''Why this is important''
Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.''What you will do''
You will use the project interlineariser to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will setup the interlineariser, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can export it to the back translation project.

!18: CT – Compare Text
''Introduction ''
In this module, you will learn how to save old versions of your text and review them later.''Where are we? ''
You have worked on your text and you have arrived at an important stage of your project.''Why is this important?''
As you work on your translation, you are continually making changes. It is good to have a copy of the previous version of your text, for example the text as it was before you went to a consultant check. You can do this by marking a point in the history of your project. After marking a point in the history, you can compare the version at that point with the current version.''What will you do?''
You will mark a point in the history of the project which you can go back to later and compare your work
----

!19: BC3 – Basic checks 3
''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.''Where we are''
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules BC1 and BC2 before continuing. And that either your administrator has done the setup for the checks or is available to do the setup with you.''Why this is important''
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks helps you find errors related to material referred from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.''What you are going to do''
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:
* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.
----
!!19.1: Unmatched pairs of Punctuation

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}

!24: PP – Compare Parallel Passages
''Introduction''
There are thousands of passages in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.''Where we are''
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first before comparing the texts. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.''Why this is important''
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.
Normally you would make the comparisons after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.''What you are going to do''
* use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
* use the check boxes to tell Paratext that you have checked the passages
* filter for any changed verses
* open a quick reference window in Paratext to see another passage while you are translating.
* open a third passage in a window.

!!1.3: Course Plan

''Introductions, setup''''Introduce yourself''
The participant and facilitators should introduce themselves giving:
* their name
* their language
* their town
* what was the first and last (most recent) version of Paratext that you have used.

* Follow the summary for the other skills:
* Demonstration
* Do it together
* Let the participants redo it themselves
* Ask a participant to demonstrate the skill.
* Ask questions.
* Do a revision activity.
* Give the participant time to reflect, fill in the recall exercise, add to Anki.!Stage 1 – Drafting
''Introduction''
There are several stages in a translation project. In this first stage you will use many of the resources to ensure that you understand the source text, then you will draft and keyboard the text of the translation along with other materials and also begin the preliminary checks.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image2.png" class=img-responsive}
The following modules will help you in this stage :
* ((OD – Organising your desktop|OD – Organising your desktop))
* ((PP1 – Project plan and progress|PP1 – Project plan and progress))
* ((KD – Keyboarding your draft|KD – Keyboarding your draft))
* ((GL – Glossary|GL – Glossary))
* ((BC1 – Basic checks|BC1 – Basic checks))
* ((PP2 – Project progress|PP2 – Project progress))
!2: __OD – Organising your desktop__
''Introduction''
As you work with your text in Paratext 9 you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.''Where we are''
We are about to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.''Why this is important''
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.''What are you going to do?''
You will start the Paratext 9 program and open a previously saved text combination. If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.
''Changes in Paratext 9''
The menus have changed in Paratext 9.To see the menu you now need to click on the menu icon ≡. There are now two types of menus. The main Paratext menu is on the title bar ({img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgfr/IconParatextMenu.png" class=img-responsive}) and each window (or tab) has its own menu ({img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgfr/Iconprojmenu.png" class=img-responsive}). When you click on one of these menu icons all the menus are displayed and you just need to click on the command.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
In the manual, when it says __≡ Paratext__, __Menu__ > __Command__. It means click on the Paratext menu icon ≡, then under the menu (e.g. File) choose the command (e.g. Open). And when it says __≡ Tab__, __Menu__ > __Command__ it means click on the tab menu icon, then under the menu (e.g. Tools) click on the command (e.g. Wordlist){BOX}

!3: __PP1 – Project plan and progress__ {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/pt9.png" class=img-responsive}
''Introduction''
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and to see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task, you should mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [[If you have used an earlier version you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 9 .]''Where are we?''
Before you can use the plan, it must have been configured. [[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]''Why is this important?''
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisors and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).''What are we going to do?''
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

!5: GL – Glossary
''Introduction''
This module explains how to add entries to the glossary using the __Biblical terms__ tool.''Where we are''
You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 9. Now you will draft and enter some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.''Why this is important''
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the __Biblical terms__ tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.''What you are going to do''
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.

!6: BC1 – Basic checks
''Introduction ''
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers using two methods: the Project plan and the Checking menu.''Where we are''
You have typed your text in Paratext 9. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks. The remaining checks are covered in ((BC2 – Basic Checks|BC2 – Basic Checks)) in this manual and chapter 5 in the following manual.''Why this is important''
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage.''What you are going to do''
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods.The easiest way is to run the checks from the project plan. However, you can also do the checks from the __checking__ menu if you need to check more than one book at a time.

You have been working on your translation and have finished a task. You now want to update your progress.''Why this is important''
For the project plan to work well, you need to mark the tasks you have finished. This allows Paratext 9 to make the next task available for the other team members. It also gives Paratext accurate information on your progress for the reports. Creating a progress reports helps you prepare a report for your supervisors and funders.''What you are going to do''
You will open the assignments and progress window and update the progress made. You will then produce a report.

!9: SP – Spell Checking
''Introduction''
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into your project in Paratext 9 .''Where we are''
You have typed your text in Paratext 9 and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.''Why is this important?''
It is important to correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.''What you are going to do''
Firstly you need to configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words. Then you can get Paratext 9 to show red squiggly lines under the words it does not know. You can then work through your text, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 9 that the words are correct.
----
!!9.1: Configure the word list

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:{BOX}
!!!9.1.1: Approve the spelling of common words

In Paratext
* __≡ Tab__, sous __Tools__ > __Wordlist__
In the Wordlist
* __Tools__ > __Approve spelling of common words__
* Enter a number
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100 but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the acuracy of the typist).{BOX}
* Click __OK__
* Click __Yes__ (to confirm that you can’t undo)
!!!9.1.2: Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect

In the Wordlist (__Tools__ > __Word List__)
* __Tools__ > __Spell Check > All checks__A list of words is displayed.
* Click on a word in the top pane.
* If the word is correct – click the green checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26.png" class=img-responsive}
* If the word is incorrect, but Paratext 9 has suggested the correct word, then click the blue link for the correct word.
* If the word is incorrect, and Paratext 9 hasn’t suggested the correct word, click on the red checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26a.png" class=img-responsive} and correct the word. (See 9.3)
!!!9.1.3: Check similarly spelled words

In the Wordlist
* __Tools__ > __Find Similar Words__
* Enter letters which sound alike separated by / (e.g. s/sh/z)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Depending on your language, tick or untick “Ignore all diacritics when comparing words”.{BOX}
* Click __OK__ A list of words is displayed.
* Correct the words (as described above).
----
!!9.2: Spell checking – from the text

In Paratext
* __Checking__ > __Display spelling__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
A progress meter is displayed initially, then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.{BOX}
----
!!9.3: Making corrections

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext 9 will underline in red the words that have not been approved in the word list. This either means that the word is misspelled or unknown.{BOX}
* Right-click a word which is underlined in either red or greyA dialogue is displayed {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list
* Click __OK__
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext 9 will remember the correction and you can apply the correction if it happens again.{BOX}

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed. Choose as appropriate:
__Yes__ = changes this verse and looks for the next__No__ = skips this verse and looks for the next__Yes to all__ – is too dangerous, DON’T use it__Cancel__ = stops further changes{BOX}

!10: BT – A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms
''Introduction''
The __Biblical terms rendering__ window and the separate __Biblical terms__ tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This is a process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.''Where we are''
You are translating a verse in Paratext 9 and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.''Why this is important''
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.''What you are going to do''
This method boils down to a short list of steps:
# [[A] Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
# [[B] Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
# [[C] Document why you rejected the other renderings.
# [[D] Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
* Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
----
!!10.1: Open the Biblical terms rending window

* Click in your project
* __File__ > __Open Biblical terms rendering__
* __File__ > __Select Biblical terms list__
* Choose the desired list
* Click __OK__.
----
!!10.2: [[A] Find all the ways you have rendered this term

!!!10.2.1: Find the terms for the current verse

* Is there a tick in the found column?
* If there is a tick, your verse uses the term and you can continue with the next term.
* If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).
!!!10.2.2: Add another rendering

If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:
* Select the rendering of the term in your text.
* Copy it (__Ctrl__+__C__)
* Double-click in the renderings cell.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1.png" class=img-responsive}The edit renderings dialog is displayed.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1a.png" class=img-responsive}
* Paste (__Ctrl__+__V__) the rendering in the dialog box.
* Click __OK__.
!!!10.2.3: Find other verses in the current book with the same Biblical term

* Double-click on a word in the __Term__ columnThe Biblical Terms Tool opens
* From the second filter button choose __current book__{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings1b.png" class=img-responsive}
* Add renderings for the term from the verses until the terms in all verses are been identified (see below).
!!!10.2.4: Add renderings from the other verses

* Select the rendering in the verse
* Add the rendering using __Ctrl__+__A__
* Continue until all terms for those verses have been identified.
!!!10.2.5: Dealing with verses that don’t use the term

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example when a pronoun is used. In this case you need to deny that it is an error.{BOX}
* Click the red cross {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive} to the left of the verse reference link. The red cross turns into a green tick with a small red x {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you click on the cross by mistake, click {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive} and it will return to {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive}.{BOX}
----
!!10.3: [[B] Identify the best term

* Double-click on the term in the top pane.The edit rendering dialog is displayed listing all the renderings that have been added.

* Add * as necessary to combine similar renderings{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/renderings2b.png" class=img-responsive}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
You can use * in a number of different ways: before the word for prefixes and after the word for suffixes. You can also put an * in the middle of a word. See the guide for more ways of using the *.{BOX}
----
!!10.4: [[C] Reject all the others

* Select and cut the other renderings.
----
!!10.5: [[D] Document the reason for the change

* Click on the History button{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image37b.png" class=img-responsive}

!11: MP – Compare a word or phrase
''Introduction''
In this module, you will search for a word or phrase in a project and compare it with the translation of that word or phrase in another project.''Why this is important?''
In Paratext 9 (and above), you can see where a word or phrase is found in one project and compare it with the equivalent word or phrase in one or more other projects. For example, you can see where "roi" is found in a French project and compare it with "rey"in a Spanish project.
You will
* use the checklist “Word or Phrase” from both the text and also from the Biblical Terms Tool.
* change the settings and comparative texts
* type the word or phrase to compare for each project 
----
!!11.1: Compare a word of phrase – from the text

* Click in the project that you want to compare
* From the __Tools__ menu, point to __Checklists__, and select __Word or Phrase__.The Parameters dialogue is displayed.

!12: BC2 – Basic Checks
''Introduction''
In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (__Characters__, __punctuation__, __capitals__, and __repeated words__. As in the first Basic Checks module (((BC1 – Basic checks|BC1 – Basic checks))), it is easiest to run these checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the __Verification__ menu.Where are we?
You have typed your translation in Paratext 9. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in ((BC1 – Basic checks|BC1 – Basic checks)), before continuing and that your administrator has either completed the setup of the checks or is with you to do the setup now.''Why this is important?''
Paratext 9 has eleven __Basic Checks__. In ((BC1 – Basic checks|BC1 – Basic checks)), you have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to spelling, punctuation, capital letters an repeated words. Even if these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.''What we are going to do:''
Most of the checks require that a certain inventory has been completed by your administrator. In this module you will
* Confirm that the setup has been done (or have the administrator do the setup)
* do the Basic Checks
* correct any errors.
----
!!12.1: Confirm the setup

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done. Some checks require an inventory others require settings. You can do most of the inventories, but only your Administrator can do the settings.{BOX}
The required setup may be an inventory, some rules or settings.
----
!!12.2: Using inventories to setup checks

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 9 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).{BOX}
Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.
* From the __Checking__ menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
* Click on an item in the list in the top pane.The verses are shown in the bottom pane.
* For each item in the top pane, choose either __Valid__ or __Invalid__.
* Repeat for each item.
* Click __OK__.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Instead of using the mouse, you can use __Ctrl__ + __y__ to mark an entry as __Valid__ or __Ctrl__ + __n__ to mark an entry as __Invalid__.{BOX}

!13: FC – Formatting checks
''Introduction''
In this module, you will find and correct formatting and layout errors.''Where we are''
You have typed your draft into a project in Paratext. You will use the checklists to find and correct errors related to the formatting and layout errors.''Why this is important''
A New Testament contains more than just chapters and verses. There are also titles, section headings, and several types of paragraphs. These checks allow you to be sure that the layout of your text is correct, and your titles etc. are consistent.''What are you going to do?''
You will use the checklists to
* compare your titles and section headings
* check your paragraph breaks 
* compare the paragraph markers in your text with those of your reference text
* add markers for special text formatting. 
----
!!13.1: Using the checklists – generic

!14: PD – Printing Drafts
''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to print a draft of your translation for checking and revising.''Where we are''
You have entered and checked your translation in Paratext 9 and are now ready to print out a copy. Your project must be registered before you can print.''Why this is important''
It is much easier to revise and check your work on paper than on the computer. You can also give it to more people if it is on paper.''What you are going to do''
You will first produce a PDF version of your translation, which you can print or share with others (including non-Paratext users). If necessary your can copy the PDF file onto your USB stick and take it to a computer with a printer.
----
!!14.1: Create a PDF file

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Make sure you have completed a markers check before printing a draft.{BOX}
* __≡ project__, under __File__ > __Export Draft PDF__
* Check that your project is selected.
* Choose which book(s) and chapters to print.
* Choose the page settings as follows :
* Page size: 210mm, 297mm (A4) ou 148mm, 210mm (A5)
* Columns : 1
* Margins : 25 mm  (for A4) or 12 mm  (for A5)
* Text body font: Charis SIL (or Charis SIL Compact)
* Size: 10 (or 11)
* Line spacing: 1.0 (for single spacing)
* Click on the __Avanced__ tab 
* Choose the fonts 
* Choose what you want in the __Running header__ (the text at the top of the page). 
* Check __mirror layout on odd and even pages__  
* Make any other choices as needed. 
* Click __OK__ and wait, the file will open in your PDF reader.If there are marker errors, a message box will appear. Click No, then correct the errors and try again.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: The first time you print a draft it takes a long time collecting information on the fonts. But it will be much quicker the next time.{BOX}
----
!!14.2: Print a PDF

In Adobe Reader
* (Make sure the PDF file is open.)
* __File__ > __Print.__
* For A5
* Choose __Booklet__
* Orientation : portrait (for newer printers or landscape for Win7)
* To print double-sided
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you want to follow a punctuation system (such as French) and have spaces automatically inserted before complex punctuation, then see a consultant to have changes made to your PrintDraftChanges.txt{BOX}
----
!!14.3: Copy PDF file to a USB stick

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext saves the PDF file in the PrintDrafts folder of your project folder. For example, C:\My Paratext 9 Projects\XXX\PrintDraft
There are many ways to copy files. One method is described below.{BOX}
* Hold the Windows Key and type __E__Windows Explorer opens.
* Go to your __My Paratext 8 Projects__ folder.
* Double-click on your project folder
* Double-click the __PrintDraft__ folder
* Right-click on the desired PDF file
* Choose __Send to__
* Choose your USB stick.
!15: UN – Using Notes
''Introduction ''
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext 9 allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.''Where we are''
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Attention: Notes and footnotes are very different. Footnotes are printed in the New Testament whereas notes are for questions and comments and are not printed in the New Testament.{BOX}''What you are going to do''
You will:
* create notes in the text using different icons,
* edit the notes and resolve notes
* open a note window from the text
* filter the list
* print a list of the notes
* add rendering discussion notes to a Biblical terms list
* add spelling notes to the wordlist.

!16: BT1 – Draft a Back Translation
''Introduction''
This module explains how to draft a back translation into a separate Paratext project and keep it up-to-date. [[The next module will explain how to do a word by word gloss of the translation using the project interlinearizer.]''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.''Why is this important?''
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term “back translation” comes from. The consult will use this translation to help your team improve your exegetical choices in the text.
It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.''What will you do?''
* Open your project and back translation project
* Arrange your text on the screen.
* Draft your back translation
* Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
* Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.

!17: BT2 – Interlinearise a project
''Introduction''
The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Please note that in Paratext 9 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.{BOX}''Where we are''
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word for word back translation. [[This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]''Why this is important''
Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.''What you will do''
You will use the project interlineariser to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will setup the interlineariser, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can export it to the back translation project.
----
!!17.1: Create a new project for the back translation

(First time only by Administrator)
* __≡ Paratext__, sous __Paratext__ > __New Project__

!18: CT – Compare Text
''Introduction ''
In this module, you will learn how to save old versions of your text and review them later.''Where are we? ''
You have worked on your text and you have arrived at an important stage of your project.''Why is this important?''
As you work on your translation, you are continually making changes. It is good to have a copy of the previous version of your text, for example the text as it was before you went to a consultant check. You can do this by marking a point in the history of your project. After marking a point in the history, you can compare the version at that point with the current version.''What will you do?''
You will mark a point in the history of the project which you can go back to later and compare your work
----

!19: BC3 – Basic checks 3
''Introduction''
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.''Where we are''
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules BC1 and BC2 before continuing. And that either your administrator has done the setup for the checks or is available to do the setup with you.''Why this is important''
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks helps you find errors related to material referred from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.''What you are going to do''
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:
* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.
----
!!19.1: Unmatched pairs of Punctuation

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check looks at punctuation that occurs in pairs (opening and closing) and lists errors where it is not matched by the other half of the pair. This may be deliberate but is more likely to be an error, e.g. ( ), [[ ], etc.{BOX}

!24: PP – Compare Parallel Passages
''Introduction''
There are thousands of passages in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.''Where we are''
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first before comparing the texts. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.''Why this is important''
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.
Normally you would make the comparisons after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.''What you are going to do''
* use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
* use the check boxes to tell Paratext that you have checked the passages
* filter for any changed verses
* open a quick reference window in Paratext to see another passage while you are translating.
* open a third passage in a window.
