!1: Introduction

----
!!1.1: Goal

This manual is intended to teach skills that are beyond the scope of the typical MTT's work, or skills that are most useful when working with multiple projects.
This little manual is not intended as a course, but as several small sections.
----
!!1.2: Course Objectives
!Consultant Skills


!2: Notes

Because the consultant normally does not have the right to modify project text, a consultant will communicate with the team through notes.
----
!!2.1: Regular Notes

To learn how to use notes, see the section ''Using Notes'' in the book ''Stages 1 and 2''.
----
!!2.2: Consultant Notes Project

As a consultant, you can create a shared project that does not contain Bible books, but only notes. This project can be shared with multiple teams.
As stated in the Paratext help:
%%%A Consultant Notes project is NOT intended for a note from a consultant to a translator about a particular translation project (which can be assigned to the translator), but instead for notes which are relevant for multiple translation projects. For example:
* A consultant can insert notes in a personal project which represents a checklist for consulting with translators.
* A consultant can insert notes in a personal project which represents a checklist for consulting with translators.
* Several translators and consultants can have roles on a project for discussions which affect an entire cluster of related languages (for example, to reach a consensus about biblical terms).%%%
Because this type of note cannot be resolved, you should choose an icon that is easily distinguished from project notes. The default icon for a consultant note is a light blue plus sign.
