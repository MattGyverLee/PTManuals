!8: Stage 2 : Team Checking
Introduction 
The second stage of a translation project involves checking by the team. In this second stage you will use many tools to ensure that you have been consistent in your translation. You will read through your text, work on proper names, Biblical key terms, spell checking, and formatting checks. You will also print out a draft and use a variety of notes: project notes, spelling notes, Biblical terms notes to record your questions, discussions and decisions.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image22.png" class=img-responsive}

!10: SP: Spell Checking
Introduction
This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into you project in Paratext 8 .Where we are
You have type your text in Paratext 8 and have done some checks but there may still be spelling mistakes in the text.Why is this important?
It is important the correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.What you are going to do
Firstly you need to configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words. Then you can get Paratext 8 to show red squiggly lines under the words it does not know. You can then work through your text, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 8 that the words are correct.What has changed in Paratext 8 
Paratext 8 has a number of specific checks that you can run on the wordlist. It can also highlight invalid characters in you text.Summary
This module shows you how to:
----
!!10.1: Configure the word list

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:{BOX}
!!!10.1.1: Approve the spelling of common words

In Paratext
* Tools > Wordlist
In the Wordlist
* Tools > Approve spelling of common words
* Enter a number
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100 but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the acuracy of the typist).{BOX}
* Click OK
* Click Yes (to confirm that you can’t undo)
!!!10.1.2: Check the words that Paratext 8 thinks are incorrect 

In the Wordlist (Tools > WordList)
* Tools > Spell Check > All checks''A list of words is displayed.''
* Click on a word in the top pane.
* If the word is correct – click the green checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26.png" class=img-responsive}
* If the word is incorrect, but Paratext 8 has suggested the correct word, then click the blue link for the correct word.
* If the word is incorrect, and Paratext 8 hasn’t suggested the correct word, click on the red checkbox {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image26a.png" class=img-responsive} and correct the word.
!!!10.1.3: Check similarly spelled words

In the Wordlist
* Tools > Find Similar Words
* Enter letters which sound alike separated by / (e.g. s/sh/z)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Depending on your language, tick or untick « Ignore all diacritics when comparing words ».{BOX}
* Click OK
* ''A list of words is displayed.''
* Correct the words (as described above).
----
!!10.2: Spell checking – from the text 

In Paratext
* Checking > Display spelling
* Vérification  > Afficher l’orthographe
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
A progress meter is displayed initially then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.{BOX}
----
!!10.3: Making corrections

* Right-click a word which is underlined in either red or greyA dialogue is displayed{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image27.png" class=img-responsive}
* Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list
* Click OK
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext 8 will remember the correction and can apply the correction if it happens again.{BOX}

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed. Choose as appropriate:
Yes = changes this verse and looks for the nextNo = skips this verse and looks for the nextYes to all – is too dangerous, DON’T use itCancel = stops changing any more{BOX}
----
!!10.4: Spell checking – current book

* Checking > Spell Check Current Book ''A window appears with a list of some words in the current book.''

!11: BT: A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Terms 
Introduction
The Biblical terms rendering window and the separate Biblical terms tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.Where we are
You are translating a verse in Paratext 8 and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.Why this is important
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.What you are going to do
This method boils down to a short list of steps:
# Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
# Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
# Document why you rejected the other renderings.
# Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
----
!!11.1: Open the Biblical terms rending window

* Click in your project
* File > Open Biblical terms rendering
* File > Select Biblical terms list
* Choose the desired list
* Click OK.
----
!!11.2: Find the terms for the current verse

* Is there a tick in the found column?
* If there is a tick, your verse uses the term and you can continue with the next term.
* If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).
----
!!11.3: Add another rendering

If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:
* Select the rendering of the term in your text.
* Copy it (ctrl+c)
* Double-click in the renderings cell.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image35.png" class=img-responsive}''The edit renderings dialog is displayed.''{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image37a.png" class=img-responsive}
* Paste (Ctrl+v) the rendering in the dialog box.
* Click OK.
----
!!11.4: Find other verses in the current book with the same Biblical term

* Double-click on a word in the Term column''The Biblical Terms Tool opens''
* From the second filter button choose current book
* Add renderings for the term from the verses until the terms in all verses are been identified (see below).
----
!!11.5: Add renderings from the other verses

* Select the rendering in the verse
* Add the rendering using Ctrl+A
* Continue until all terms for those verses have been identified.
----
!!11.6: Dealing with verses that don’t use the term

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example when a pronoun is used. In this case you need to deny that it is an error.{BOX}
* Click the red cross {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image24.png" class=img-responsive} to the left of the verse reference link. The red cross turns into a green tick with a small red x {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image25.png" class=img-responsive}
If you click on the cross by mistake, click on it again and it will return to a red X.
----
!!11.7: Identify the best term

* Double-click on the term in the top pane.''The edit rendering dialog is displayed listing all the renderings that have been added.''
* Decide on the best rendering
* Cut (Ctrl+x) and paste (Ctrl+v) it to the top of the dialogue box
* Add * as necessary to combine similar renderings
----
!!11.8: Reject all the others

* Select and cut the other renderings.
----
!!11.9: Document the reason for the change

* Click on the History button{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image37b.png" class=img-responsive}
* Type in the reason why the others were rejected and why the first was the best.
* Click OK
----
!!11.10: If you need more than one rendering

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
You can add more than one rendering if appropriate. In this case it is good to add a back translation in brackets after then rendering. For example,  slave (slave) guy * work fo (guy that works for){BOX}
* Open the Edit renderings dialog box
* Edit the renderings as needed.
----
!!11.11: Clean up other books (as time permits)

* Change the filter so that all the published books are displayed.
* Clean up verses as necessary.
----
!!11.12: Add the Biblical terms notes - ongoing discussion

* Double-click on the note icon (in the second column){img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image37.png" class=img-responsive}
* Type in the note
* Assign the note as necessary.
* Click OK.
----
!!11.13: Add the decision to the renderings description

* Double-click on the term
* Type the agreed-on rendering in the description field{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image37a.png" class=img-responsive}
* Click OK
----
!!11.14: Add a term

In Paratext
* From your reference text, do a find (using Edit > Find) and search for the term.''A list is displayed showing the verses with that term.''
From the list of results
* Edit > Add to Project Biblical Terms, then choose your project{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgfr/image42.png" class=img-responsive}
* Edit the gloss if necessary
* Click on the Advanced tab
* Type in a name for the term
* Click OK
!12: MP: Compare a word or phrase

In this module, you will search for a word or phrase in a project and compare it with the translation of that word or phrase in another project.Why this is important?In Paratext 8 (and above), you can see where a word or phrase is found in one project and compare it with the word or phrase (or a translation of the word or phrase) is found in one or more other projects. For example, you can see where "roi" is found in a French project and compare it with "rey"in a Spanish project.
You will
* use the checklist “Word or Phrase” from both the text and also the Biblical Terms Too.
* change the settings and comparative texts
* type the word or phrase to compare for each project SummaryThis module shows how to:
----
!!12.1: Compare a word of phrase - from the text

* Choose a term which has a rendering
* Click on the tool icon
The Setting dialogue is displayed with the rending filled-in.
* Type the word or expression for the other projects
* Click OK
!13: BC2: Basic checks

In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (Characters, punctuation, capitals, and repeated words. As in the first Basic Checks module (((PARATEXT_8_1-2_IntroStage1|13.: BC1: Basic checks|BC1: Basic checks))), it is easiest to run these checks from the project plan. Nevertheless, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the Verification menu.Where are we?
You have typed your translation in Paratext 8. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in ((PARATEXT_8_1-2_IntroStage1|13.: BC1: Basic checks|BC1: Basic checks)), before continuing.Why this is important?
Paratext 8 has eleven Basic Checks.In ((PARATEXT_8_1-2_IntroStage1|13.: BC1: Basic checks|BC1: Basic checks)), you have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to spelling, punctuation, capital letters an repeated words. Even if these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.What we are going to do:
Most of the verifications require that a certain inventory has been completed.
* Confirm that the setup has been done
* do the Basic Checks
* correct any errorsSummary
This module shows you how to:
----
!!13.1: Confirm the setup

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done by your Administrator.{BOX}
The required configuration may be an inventory or selection of parameters.
----
!!13.2: Using inventories to setup checks

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 8 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).{BOX}
Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.
* From the Checking menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
* Click on an item in the list in the top pane.The verses are shown in the bottom pane.

!14: FC: Formatting checks
Introduction
In this module, you will find and correct formatting and layout errors.Where we are
You have typed your draft into a project in Paratext. You will use the checklists to find and correct errors related to the formatting and layout errors.Why this is important
A New Testament contains more than just chapters and verses. There are also titles, section headings, and several types of paragraphs. These checks allow you to be sure that the layout of your text is correct, and your titles etc. are consistent.
You will use the checklists to
* compare your titles and section headings
* check your paragraph breaks 
* compare the paragraph markers in your text with those of your reference text
* add markers for special text formatting

!15: PD: Printing Drafts
Introduction
In this module you will learn how to print a draft of your translation for checking and revising.Where we are
You have entered and checked your translation in Paratext 8 and are now ready to print out a copy. Your project must be registered before you can print.Why this is important
It is much easier to revise and check your work on paper than on the computer. You can also give it to more people if it is on paper.What you are going to do
You will first produce a PDF version of your translation, which you can print or share with non-Paratext users. If necessary your can copy the PDF file onto your USB stick and take it to a computer with a printer.

!16: UN: Using Notes
Introduction 
As you are translating and checking you may want to make comments on various errors or issues. You may also want to record your discussions on key terms and spelling issues. Paratext 8 allows you to record these comments either in the text, the Biblical terms list or the wordlist.Where we are
You are typing or revising your text, wordlist or keyterms and need to make comments on an issue you have seen.
