* Follow the summary for the other skills:
* Demonstration
* Do it together
* Let the participants redo it themselves
* Ask a participant to demonstrate the skill.
* Ask questions.
* Do a revision activity.
* Give the participant time to reflect, fill in the recall exercise, add to Anki.
Stage 1 : Drafting
Introduction
There are several stages in a translation project. In this first stage you will use many of the resources to ensure that you understand the source text, then you will draft and keyboard the text of the translation along with other materials and also begin the preliminary checks.
{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/12imgeng/image2.png" class=img-responsive}
The following modules will help you in this stage :
* OB: Organising your desktop
* PP1: Project plan – the next task
* KD: Keyboarding your draft
* GL: Adding glossary items
* BC1: Basic checks – chapter/verse and markers.
* PP2 : Project plan – complete a task
!2: OD : Organising your desktop 

||Start %%%Paratext |Use combinations of windows |Open your project |Open resources (source text, texts collection…) |Create a list of verses from the source text ||
Introduction
As you work with your text in Paratext you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.Where we are
We are about to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.Why this is important
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.What are you going to do?
You will start the Paratext program and open a saved combination. If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text combination.

!3: PP1 : Project Plan and progress 
Introduction
You use the Project Plan to help organise your work and see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task you mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [If you have used an earlier version of you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 8.]Where are we?
Before you can use the plan it must have been configured.[This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]Why is this important?
There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. Then when you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisers and donors (see PP2: Project plan reporting).What are we going to do?
You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.

Introduction
This module explains how to keyboard your draft translations into a project which has already been created in Paratext.Where we are
We are about to keyboard text into an existing project. Before you can do that, someone must have already installed the program and created a project for your data.Why this is important
This is the first stage of putting your translation into the computer. Once the text has been typed, you can run various checks on the content and format of the text.
