!Stage 3: Preparing for the Consultant check

!3: Introduction to Stage 3
Introduction
In this third stage of a translation project you will do comprehension testing and back translation. You will also continue with the basic checks and spell checking.
{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/36imgeng/image5.png" class=img-responsive}
The following modules will help you in this stage:
* BT1 and BT2: Back translations
* BC3: Basic checks
* PPU: Update progress plan
!4: BT1: Draft a Back translation 

||Create a new project %%%for the back translation%%%(first time only) |Draft the back translation |Mark a chapter as finished |Viewing differences |Project plan ||Introduction
This module explains how to draft a back translation into a separate Paratext project and keep it up-to-date. [The next module will explain how to do a word by word gloss of the translation using the project interlinearizer.]Where we are
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your back translation.Why is this important?
Your text needs to be check by a consultant. But because the consultant does not know your language, you need to translate your text back into a language they can understand. This is where the term back translation comes from. The consult will use this translation to help the team improve your exegetical choices in the text.
It is preferable that this is done by someone who hasn’t been involved in your translation. This way she will type what the text says and not what you meant it to say. This should also be done without looking at any helps or other Bibles.What will you do?
* Open your project and back translation project
* Arrange your text on the screen.
* Draft your back translation
* Mark the status as finished when you complete a chapter.
* Check that your text is up-to-date (or in sync), view any differences by moving to the next change if appropriate.Summary
This module shows you how to:
----

!5: BT2: Interlinearise a project 

||Create a new project for the second back translation (first time only) |Setup project interlineariser |Correct glosses |Exporter / approve the verses ||
||Créez un nouveau projet pour %%%la retraduction |Créez une glose interlinéaire %%%mot à mot |Corriger les gloses |Exporter / %%%approuver le verset ||Introduction
The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function. Please note that in Paratext 8 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.Where we are
You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check. Before you can start your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word for word back translation. [This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]Why this is important
Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.What you will do
You will use the project interlineariser to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will setup the interlineariser, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can export it to the back translation project.

!7: BC3: Basic checks 3
Introduction
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.Where we are
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules BC1 and BC2 before continuing.Why this is important
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks help you find errors related to material refered from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.What you are going to do
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:
* Confirm that the setup has been done
* Run the basic check
* Correct any errors.Summary
This module shows you how to:
----
!!7.1: Unmatched pairs of Punctuation

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This check looks at punctuation that occurs in pairs (opening and closing) and lists errors where it is not matched by the other half of the pair. This may be deliberate but is more likely to be an error, e.g. ( ), [ ], etc.{BOX}
* Checking > Unmatched pairs of punctuation:''If the list is empty, then there are no errors.''
* If necessary, click Options... to add other pairs.
* Click OK.
* Checking > Run Basic Checks
* Check “Unmatched pairs of punctuation”
* Click OK.
* Make any corrections as needed.
----
!!7.2: References

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can run the references check, your Administrator must define various settings.{BOX}
* Project > Scripture reference settings{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/36imgeng/image18.png" class=img-responsive}
* For each setting, type the punctuation in the box''The sample will be updated on the right.''
* Click the Book names tab{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/36imgeng/image19.png" class=img-responsive}
* Fill-in the three columns [1] with abbreviation, short name and long name.
* Choose Abbreviations[2] and [3] for both cross-references and references
* Click OK
* Checking > Run Basic Checks
* Click « References »
* Click OK
* Correct any errors.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Paratext will inform you if there are any inconsistencies between these book name settings and the \toc lines and will allow you to check conflicts.{BOX}
----
!!7.3: Numbers check

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can run the references check, your Administrator must define various number settings.{BOX}
* Checking > Number settings
* Fill-in the dialog box.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/36imgeng/image20.png" class=img-responsive}
* Click OK
* Checking > Run basic checks
* Click « Numbers»
* Click OK
----
!!7.4: Quotation rules

The quotations check is used to ensure you have been consistent in marking the direct speech correctly.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Before you can run the quotation check, your Administrator must define the rules for your quotations.{BOX}
* Checking > Quotation rules
* Fill-in the quotation marks used for each level [1] [2] [3]

----
!!7.6: Quoted text

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}

* Checking > Basic checks
* Quoted text
* Click OK.''A list of errors is displayed.''
* Make corrections as needed.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
