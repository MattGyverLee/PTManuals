!11: PP: Compare parallel passages 
Introduction
There are thousands of passage in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.Where we are
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.Why this is important
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.
Normally you would make the comparisons made after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.What you are going to do
* use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
* use the check boxes to tell Paratext that you have checked the passages
* filter for changed verses
* open a quick reference window in Paratext to see another passage while you are translating.Summary
