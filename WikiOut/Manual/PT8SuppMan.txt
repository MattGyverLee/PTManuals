!1: IS: Install Paratext 8

Introduction
Paratext 8 is the result of a concerted effort to streamline the process of managing translation projects and accessing resources. As a result, both the data and the servers had to change. People wanted less hassle with registration and waiting for codes to be approved. They wanted access to more resources. They wanted a free version of Paratext that didn’t need a license in order to use. Now we have that in Paratext 8.
Where We are
You have already installed Paratext 7 and now want to install Paratext 8.
Why is this Important
Paratext 7 and Paratext 8 can both be installed at the same time but you need to understand the limitation of using them together.
* Both may be installed
* They use different data directories.
* 
* My Paratext Projects (Paratext 7)
* My Paratext 8 Projects (Paratext 8)
* My Paratext Projects (Paratext 7)
* My Paratext 8 Projects (Paratext 8)
* They use different data servers
What are you going to do?
You will install Paratext 8 (without uninstalling Paratext 7). You will also install an update from an MSP file.

!2: MD: Migrate Data

----
!!2.1: Introduction

Migration is the process of moving a project (including all settings files) from Paratext 7 to Paratext 8. This is similar to the process of setting up S/R for the first time in Paratext 7.x. Note: all users of a project have to migrate at the same time.
''Where We are''
You have already installed Paratext 8 and you have a Paratext 7 project that you want to use in Paratext 8.
''Why is this Important ?''
In order to get the full functionality of Paratext 8 your project needs to be migrated. Paratext 7 and Paratext 8 use different send/receive servers so there is no way for a project to be shared with some users on Paratext and some users on Paratext 8. It is also hoped that the old (Paratext 7) server will be closed down soon. So it is important to migrate as soon as possible.
Users can have both Paratext 7 and Paratext 8 on their computers at the same time, and run one or the other, but no project can be shared simultaneously with users in Paratext 7 and other users in Paratext 8.
Once you have migrated the project, everyone on the team needs to get the migrated project, and only do work in Paratext 8 from then on.
You need to have a good Internet connection to migrate the project, but if you usually work without an Internet connection, you can keep working that way in Paratext 8 once the project is migrated.
''What are you going to do?''
You will
* migrate a shared project
* migrate a non-shared project
----
!!2.2: Migrate Shared project

If you administer a project that is shared in Paratext 7 and you want to migrate it to Paratext 8, this is how you need to proceed.
!!!2.2.1: Prepare a Paratext 7 project for migration 

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
All your users have to migrate at the same time.{BOX}
* All users must do send/receive in Paratext 7 (then cease working in Paratext 7).
* The Administrator then confirms that the text is in a good state.
* The Administrator then loads Paratext 8.
* File > Open Project/Resource
* Click the box at the bottom left to show Paratext 7 projects
* {img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image2.png" class=img-responsive}
* Choose the project to migrate.''It will likely be described as “v7, unregistered.”''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Some active Paratext 7 projects have been registered already for Paratext 8. If yours is one of them, Paratext 8 will show the project as P7 but show it as registered. You can skip the registration step we’ll show you if your project is already registered.{BOX}
* Click OK to start Migrating the Project.''The ‘Migrate shared project’ dialog is displayed.''{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image3.png" class=img-responsive}''Paratext 8may tell you the project must be registered (if it is not preregistered) and it must be migrated to Paratext 8.''
!!!2.2.2: Register a project (before migrating the project)

* Click the Register online button
* Fill in the web form. (Fields with an asterisk [red star] are required.)
* Short name: You cannot change the project short name,
* Long project name: You can change the long project name.
* Paratext 8 requires a language identifier for your language. Use the search in the language name to find the ethnologue code for your language. You can modify the language name, or use the “advanced” to specify or create additional information about the language.
* Scope refers to whether the project will be a complete Bible, or complete Bible including apocrypha, or New Testament, or some other grouping of books. You can add more books to your project scope later as this can be changed after registration.
* Translation type refers to whether it is the first translation for this language, a revision of an existing translation, or a new translation, or a translation including study materials, such as a study Bible. For a revision, you have to specify that you have permission from the rights holders of the translation you are revising.
* Specify the country where the language is spoken. You can type a few letters of the name then pick the desired country. You can specify more than one country if the language spreads across borders
* The rights holder would be the organization you expect will have the copyright for a print edition. This too can be changed if it needs to be later on.
* The last four fields allow you to add more information if it is relevant for describing your project. (None of these are required.)
* You can mark if your project is confidential or not. Only Paratext 8 registered users can view the name of standard projects, a confidential project will be hidden even from other Paratext 8 users.
* Another option is to mark a project as a test or training project. You can use this option for test projects you create, or for projects you use for practice in a training course.
* The last requirement to register is stating that you agree to follow the FOBAI guidelines in your translation project, and you agree to store a backup copy of your project in the Digital Bible Library.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
The Digital Bible Library is a tool for making translations available online or for mobile users, but your project will not be available to anyone until you agree to make it available.{BOX}
* To submit the registration, click Submit Registration.''The registry should tell you that the project registered successfully. (You may need to scroll to the top of the page to see this).''
{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image4.png" class=img-responsive}
* Go back to Paratext.''It should detect that the project is now registered, and inform you of that.''{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image5.png" class=img-responsive}
!!!2.2.3: Migrating a registered project

* The migration step has several boxes you have to check off to verify that you understand what is involved.
* Put a check in these boxes if they are true, then click Migrate now to proceed.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If you need to do something else before you are ready to migrate, click “Migrate Later,” and go finish your preparations.{BOX}
When you click “Migrate now,” Paratext will copy the project from your Paratext 7 into your Paratext 8, and will also do a send/receive to the Internet.
Now your colleagues can go to Paratext 8and do a Send/Receive to receive the migrated project.
If they do not have an Internet connection, you can do a send/receive to USB or a network folder, and they can receive the project into Paratext 8 that way.
----
!!2.3: Additional Project settings

* Language identifier: After you click “Migrate now”, Paratext 8 may tell you that need to specify a language identifier for your project.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
You can verify what the language name and language identifier are for your project by going to Project > Project Properties and settings, and looking at the language settings. The language identifier is either in brackets after the language name, or listed separately below the name.{BOX}
* Books The project properties and settings has a “Books” tab, you specify here the books that you plan to track their progress in your project.{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image6.png" class=img-responsive}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
You can choose book by book, or specify Old Testament, New Testament, Deuterocanon by using the buttons. You can change this list of books later on in the project if your plans for the project change.{BOX}
Note: Once you have migrated your project, you need to migrate the back translation and any other daughter projects (one after the other).
----
!!2.4: Migrate Non-shared project

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
If a project was not shared in Paratext 7 then you do not have to register it in order to migrate.{BOX}
* Run Paratext 8
* File > Open Project/Resource
* Click "Show Paratext 7 Projects”
* Choose the desired project
* Click Migrate Now{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image7.png" class=img-responsive}''When you click “Migrate” the project will be migrated to the Paratext 8 folder and ready to be used. The registration status will determine what functionality exists for the project.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Note: Non-shared projects don't have to be registered but it is recommended.{BOX}
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Remember, no one should edit the project anymore in Paratext 7. That would be wasted effort as no one else will see their changes. To help your team members remember this, you could have them remove the project from their Paratext 7 once they have gotten it in Paratext 8. Or maybe they can uninstall Paratext 7 from their computer if they don't need it for other projects.{BOX}
!3: REG: Registration

----
!!3.1: Introduction

Starting with Paratext 8 it is a requirement that projects share their basic metadata information with the translation community. It is strongly encouraged that they share progress information [some organizations and/or donors may require this].
''Where We are?''
Paratext 8 has been installed on your computer and you have the Paratext 7 registration codes for your team members.
''Why is this Important?''
In Paratext 8 both users and projects should to be registered. Access to specific text resources, e.g. TEV, is determined by what organization you are a part of
Projects may be registered by the administrator (or a consultant serving as an administrator)
Other organizations/users are notified and may object to BoG. Basic project metadata information is available to all in ParaTExt community
If your project is not registered you will not have access to
* Interlinearizer
* Internet Send/Receive
* Statistical glossing tools (guess translation)
* Print Draft
''What are you going to do?''
* You will register a P8 user
* You will register a new P8 project
* You will see what information is displayed in the ParaTExt Registry for a registered project.
----
!!3.2: Register for Paratext 8 (with a Google account)

* Go to registry.paratext.org in your web browser.''The “Sign in” screen is displayed.''

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Keep that email, or to the code that is displayed here, because if you lose it, there is no way to look it up again. (This is a security feature, user codes are not stored on the server so they cannot be stolen if someone hacks onto the server){BOX}
----
!!3.4: Register for Paratext with a non-google account

* If your email account is not on a Google server, or if it is but you choose to not use Google to authenticate, the registry server will ask you to enter a password.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
This does not have to be your email password, you can choose a different password for your Paratext registration.{BOX}
* Enter the password you want to set up
* Enter it again as a confirmation''The server will send an email to your account with a link to verify.''
* Open your email, go to the link, and proceed to register for Paratext (see above).
----
!!3.5: Change your Paratext code

(Generate a new code)
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
There are many reasons why you may need to change your Paratext code, but especially if your computer is stolen.{BOX}
* Go to the registration website, registry.paratext.org .
* Log in (if you are not logged in)

* Go to your email, and copy the new code.
* Go back to Paratext''It may already have pasted in your new code.''
* If it has not, paste in the new code into the registration form, and click OK.''You should be reregistered.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
You will need to do this on any other computer that your Paratext code is installed on as well.{BOX}
If Paratext is not connecting to the Internet to detect that you need to give a new code, go to
* Tools > Registration Information and paste the code there.
----
!!3.6: Register a new user (who does not have an email address)

{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Any administrator of a registered project can create new user registrations if they need to add people to their project. These users do not need to have an email address.{BOX}
* Go to registry.paratext.org
* Log in if you are not already logged in.
* Click on Users{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image11.png" class=img-responsive}

* Fill in their name, and the rest of their information.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
A user added by someone else cannot be made an administrator of a project, nor a consultant. If you would like to make someone a consultant or administrator they can register themselves for Paratext, then you can add their name to the project.{BOX}
* When competed, click “Create”''The server should respond by e-mailing you the user code for the new user.''
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Hang onto this code, because it cannot be recovered again if you lose it.{BOX}

* If a translator is not part of a recognised organisation, s/he can apply to the BoG (boardofgovernors@paratext.org) to be members of "Independent Translators" pseudo organization
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
It is unclear how many text resource owners will grant access to this group{BOX}
!4: CP: Creating a new project

----
!!4.1: Introduction

In this module you will create and register a new project.
''Where We are''
You have already installed Paratext and registered a user.
''Why is this Important''
A new aspect in Paratext 8 is that projects need to be registered as well as users. This may feel like an extra complication, but it does offer benefits to users.
As we saw in the user registration section, the project administrator can create registrations for users they want to be part of their project.
''What are you going to do?''
We will create and register a new project.
----
!!4.2: Create a new project

* File > New Project''The New project dialog is displayed.''{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image13.png" class=img-responsive}

* In the name section, give the project a name and a matching short name.
{BOX(bg="#FFE6FF" width="60%")}
Once you create a project name, the short name cannot be changed, because this is the name Paratext will give to the folder containing the project files, and also the name given to the project on the Internet server. (However, you can convert the project to a new project with a different short name.){BOX}
----
!!4.4: Specify language

* If you have another Paratext project in the same language, you can just pick the language from the list in Paratext [2]. If not, you will need to create a new language.
* Click on New{img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erros84/PTManuals/master/supimgeng/image16.png" class=img-responsive}''The Choose language identifier box is displayed.''

* Fill in the information (see above)
* Click Register to submit and return to Paratext.''Paratext should "automagically" detect that the project is now registered,''
* Click OK to create the new project.
The types of projects that do not need to be registred separately:
* Projects that inherit their inscription from the parent project.
* Back translations
* Transliterations
* Auxiliary
* Consultant notes.
----
!!4.7: Editing your registration

As you work in your project, you can change your registration information later on.
* From Paratext, make sure you are connected to the Internet,
* Project > Project Properties and settings
* Click the “Manage registration” link.''This will bring up the project registration info and you can edit it. Any project administrator can edit the registration info.''

!6: PP1: Setup Project Plan

----
!!6.1: Introduction

“Progress tracking” based on a Project Plan and Assignments and Progress is a new feature in Paratext 8 that will impact the day-to-day work of translation teams.
''Where We are''
Before you can add the plan the project must have been created/or migrated.
''Why is this Important''
The Project Plan feature allows the administrator to define a set of translation tasks that your translation project will follow. Paratext comes with sets of pre-defined plans from the various Bible translation organisations that you can use a starting point. However, every project is different and therefore after adding the base plan it will need to be modified for the team.
Typically, organizations want conformity at the “Stage” level in order to facilitate meaningful tracking of the progress of project across the entire organization. However, every plan will need to be customized at the task level.
If a task is important to you and your team and you want to track its progress, then it can be included in the project plan (even if it doesn't require Paratext to do the task).
''What are you going to do?''
You will use a combination of two features: the Project Plan and the Assignments and Progress (sometimes referred to as “progress tracking”) to manage the plan by assigning team members to tasks, and tracking their progress in completing those tasks.
* Add the organizational base plan to the project (remove an old plan if necessary)
* Customize the plan for the team by adding/deleting and moving tasks
* Assign the tasks to the various team members.
----

!7: Setting up a project for success

Things to consider:
It is a dynamic process
* When a project is brand new there aren’t a log of settings that can be fixed in concrete.
* As the project matures some of the inventories begin to make sense.''Who is working on the project?''
* Setup the Users, Roles and Permissions
* Would it be helpful to have a “Simplified Menu”?''Do you need to customize the settings?''
* custom.sty
* change settings of the stylesheet
* names of markers (in other languages)
* colour to help identify features?
* custom.vrs
* identify verses that are different from default versification
What orthography will be used?
* Put the orthography in the language settings.
* (Keep in mind that what you put in the language settings could be going to the “Speech and Language Data Repository”
How will the characters be keyed?
* Keyman/MSKLC
* AutoCorrect.txt
What Quotation system will be used?
* Set up the quotation rules (Dynamic)
* Think about your rules
* Test what you have
* Adjust the rules
* Make corrections to the rules / or text as necessary
When you have some text data:
* Begin setting up the inventories
* Let’s start at the very beginning (Characters)
* Look for options in the inventories!
* Is the item valid all the time? Or just in certain situations?
Scripture Reference Settings
* What book names are you using?
* What is the format for a reference?
* Where will you put the origin of notes?
!8: CV: Convert project

----
!!8.1: Introduction

If you have ever needed to rename your project, reduce the size of your project, change user names, change the encoding or struggled with composed/decomposed diacritics, then the convert project tool will help you solve these problems.
''Where We are''
You must be the administrator of the project to do these conversions.
''Why is this Important''
Although, it is possible to make some changes to existing projects through the project and setting dialogs, several major changes require that a new project is created. Using the convert project dialog allows the new project to keep the project history.
''What are you going to do?''
We will work through the six changes that can be made to your project.
* Changing the short name of the project
* Removing deleted files from the project history
* Clean up Paratext Live history
* Convert encoding to 65001 – Unicode (UTF8)
* Normalising – composed or decomposed
* Replacing old User names
----
!!8.2: To convert a project

* From the Tools menu, choose Advanced, then Convert Project

!9: CR: Cross-references

----
!!9.1: Introduction

Most languages do not have access to concordances and other Bible study materials in their own languages. Adding cross references to your New Testament can greatly help your reader understand the text by helping your reader find passages on similar themes.
''Where We are''
Before you can insert cross references from a model text your administrator must have created all the books (and chapters and verses) in your project. They can be empty but they must be present.
''Why is this Important''
Reading the New Testament is not like reading a novel. Having access to cross references allows your reader to find similar passages on the themes. But adding cross references one by one is too tedious. The insert cross reference feature allows you to insert all the cross references at once and also converts the book names and punctuation to match your scripture reference settings. Extracting cross-references from a model text allows you to easily insert the same cross-references.
''What are you going to do?''
We are going to do three things: export the cross reference from a model text; then make sure all the settings for book names and scripture references have been entered for your project; and finally insert the cross references.
If you don't have a model text with the desired cross-reference, you can create your own list and import it.
----
!!9.2: Extract the references from the model text

* Open the model text.
* From the Tools menu, choose Cross references then Extract cross references
* Type a file name
* Click OK.''Note: Resource texts may not allow you to extract cross references.''
----
!!9.3: Check your scripture reference settings

* From the Project menu, select Scripture Reference Settings.
* Verify that the following have been correctly defined for your project (edit them if necessary):
* The punctuation on the Reference Format tab.
* The book abbreviations on the Book Names tab.
* Click OK.
----
!!9.4: Check your Language Settings

* From the Project menu, select Language Settings …
* Click the Other Characters tab.
* In the Verse segment characters box, enter at least six different characters separated by spaces.
* Click OK.
----
!!9.5: Insert Cross references

* From the Tools menu, point to Cross References, and then select Insert Cross References.
* Click Browse....
* Find the .xrf file of extracted cross references.
* Select the file, and click Open.
* If desired, select one or more of the options:(see the guide for more info)
* Click OK''If the Copyright box displays a copyright notice or required statement of acknowledgments, copy the text, and then paste it wherever you keep this kind of information for the project.''
